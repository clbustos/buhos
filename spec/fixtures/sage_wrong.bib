abstract = {This article highlights an opportunity for teaching staff in universities to utilise students’ part-time work experience to enhance learning, teaching and assessment activities. Increasing numbers of university students are working part-time while studying and, as a consequence, there have been several academic studies highlighting the adverse impact of this practice on academic performance. This has led to suggestions for changes in educational policy, seeking either to reduce students’ term-time working or to eliminate it altogether. With a gearing to business management education, this viewpoint piece provides an argument for university lecturers to embrace students’ part-time work experience and use it to enhance the learning, teaching and assessment experience. The use of students’ own work experience extends the case study method, which is common in business teaching, to give greater control and therefore reassurance to students and so yield deeper learning. The approach also strengthens the relationship between higher education and industry in that it connects more cohesively students’ work experience and university study.}

abstract = {According to some educationists, engaging disengaged students is one of the biggest challenges facing educators. While many higher education instructors may believe that they promote various areas of learning and engagement, in a recent Faculty Survey of Student Engagement faculty in the health professions reported that 39.5% of their class time is spent lecturing and only 21% is spent on experiential activities. At the same time, fewer than 20% of employers who participated in an Association of American Colleges & Universities–sponsored survey felt that most college students are prepared with the skills and knowledge needed to complete a significant applied learning project before graduation. With this in mind, faculty in an undergraduate public health program integrated engagement-based learning and teaching in the form of signature assignments into core courses throughout the 4-year curriculum to strengthen student engagement, foster deep learning, and address concerns expressed by employers. This article outlines the process used to develop the assignments, describes each of the signature assignments, discusses how assignments were assessed, and shares assessment results.}

abstract = {This article examines the pedagogical potential and challenges of the design jury as an assessment method from the perceptions of the tutor/jury member and the design students. It aims to gain an understanding of the factors that create opportunities for, and barriers to, the promotion of learning in the design jury. It inquires the possible contributions of the jury into formative evaluation processes in design education. The results show that (1) the communication modalities, and (2) the evaluation criteria influence the way tutors and students perceive design jury as a pedagogical method. While the hierarchy between the jury member and the student creates a barrier to constructive feedback, a balance between formative and summative evaluations is essential in the design jury. Transparency of evaluation criteria decreases design students’ concern for grade. The design jury could also serve for formative evaluation. A student-centred approach to design jury engenders experiences of deep learning.}
