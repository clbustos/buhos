Identifying the groups most associated with stigmatization could orientate actions to reduce this prejudice and improve patients' prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate variables associated with stigmatization toward psychiatric disorders in Brazil. METHODS: A Web-based survey was sent out to assess the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception of mental illness. Included participants were composed of Brazilians aged 18 years or over, with access to the internet and social networks. The questionnaire was available from June to August 2018 on Facebook. RESULTS: A total of 2414 respondents were included. The majority were female, white, aged between 18 and 29 years, and had more than 10 years of study. The variables associated with stigma were male sex, fewer years of education, lower household income, the presence of a psychiatric disorder in a first-degree relative, and internalized stigma. CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified variables associated with the stigma against psychiatric disorders. Future studies should propose intervention strategies, such as to foster education about mental illness and to promote the importance of seeking help from a mental health professional, to address this problem in Brazil.",20210603,139,,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.033,1879-1379,,

A detailed understanding of the reasons for not seeking or accessing help as perceived by young people is crucial to address this gap. We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO 42018088591) of quantitative and qualitative studies reporting barriers and facilitators to children and adolescents seeking and accessing professional help for mental health problems. We identified 53 eligible studies; 22 provided quantitative data, 30 provided qualitative data, and one provided both. Four main barrier/facilitator themes were identified. Almost all studies (96%) reported barriers related to young people's individual factors, such as limited mental health knowledge and broader perceptions of help-seeking. The second most commonly (92%) reported theme related to social factors, for example, perceived social stigma and embarrassment. The third theme captured young people's perceptions of the therapeutic relationship with professionals (68%) including perceived confidentiality and the ability to trust an unknown person. The fourth theme related to systemic and structural barriers and facilitators (58%), such as financial costs associated with mental health services, logistical barriers, and the availability of professional help. The findings highlight the complex array of internal and external factors that determine whether young people seek and access help for mental health difficulties. In addition to making effective support more available, targeted evidence-based interventions are required to reduce perceived public stigma and improve young people's knowledge of mental health problems and available support, including what to expect from professionals and services.",20200123,30,2,10.1007/s00787-019-01469-4,1435-165X,,

Hypotheses were made concerning the definition of a multi-class structure where each class should identify a profile characteristic of each respondent's specific role, (e.g.: mental health professional, relative, patient, and student) and specific indicators of schizophrenia (e.g.: causal beliefs, eligible treatments, social distance, perceived dangerousness and public avoidance). METHODS: This study involved 577 participants all in contact with schizophrenia with different roles. A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was applied to define a latent structure of schizophrenia aspects. Such structure was expected be affected by the interaction between respondents' roles, as external variable, and schizophrenia indicators as manifest variables. RESULTS: A four-latent-class structure representing the four respondents' roles was evidenced, further each class was characterized by schizophrenia indicators representing a profile for each role.

The aim of the study was to carry out a follow-up survey of a national survey of experiences of avoidance, discrimination and positive treatment in people with mental health problems to explore how those experiences relate to health service use. METHODS: In 2017, telephone interviews were carried out with 655 Australians aged 18+, who had participated in a 2014 survey and reported a mental health problem or scored highly on a symptom screening questionnaire. Questions covered mental health, disclosure, health service utilisation, and experiences of avoidance, discrimination and positive treatment in a variety of different settings. Regression analyses were used to assess the extent to which count of settings of experiences of avoidance, discrimination or positive treatment at baseline (2014) or follow-up (2017) predicted health service use at follow-up. RESULTS: An increase in past experiences of discrimination was associated with a greater number of visits to hospital or specialist doctors and an increase in positive treatment was associated with a greater number of visits to a mental health professional. Increases in both positive and negative experiences were associated with greater healthcare costs, but the costs were greatest for discrimination at follow-up (concurrent discrimination), primarily due to the cost of nights in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: While both discrimination and positive treatment are associated with greater healthcare costs, concurrent experiences were shown to be more important correlates of health service use than past experiences. Moreover, those in supportive environments may be more willing to engage in earlier evidence-based treatment for mental health problems.",20190829,55,2,10.1007/s00127-019-01762-2,1433-9285,,

Care models where some patients are selected for referral or consultation with a mental health professional can reinforce this binary view and the stigma associated with seeing mental health services. By only selecting patients who currently are experiencing mental health problems, current integrated care models do not offer sufficient avenues for prevention. To address these barriers, this article proposes building on current models through the development of primary mental health providers (PMHPs). PMHPs-like primary care providers-would provide regular check-ups, assessments, prevention interventions, first-line treatment, or referral to more specialized professionals. This universal approach will help decrease the binary view of mental health, decrease the stigma of seeing a mental health professional through universal access, and improve prevention efforts.",20190516,27,1,10.1007/s10880-019-09626-2,1573-3572,,

Stigma and poor access to behavioral health providers are leading barriers to care. A large ambulatory health system implemented a BH navigation program to facilitate referrals from primary care physicians (PCPs), including pediatricians and family physicians, to BH providers. We studied PCP adoption of BH navigation services over a 4-year period, from July 2014 to June 2018. We retrieved operational data regarding service utilization, patient information from electronic health records and PCP information from administrative data, and surveyed PCPs for their appraisals of navigation services. Four thousand five hundred and fifty-five referrals were made for 3,912 patients from 290 PCPs (71% of PCPs in the health system). Depression (39%), anxiety (25%), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (7%) were the most frequent reasons for referral. Referrals increased dramatically in the first half of the study period and decreased afterwards. Ninety-one percent of the PCPs agreed or strongly agreed that navigation enhanced their clinical care at 12-month survey. More than 90% of the PCPs rated the referral process, communication with navigation staff, and the overall experience as above average or excellent at 12 months. There was a decrease in these evaluation indicators after 2.5 years. The initial high referral volume reflects a need for BH navigation services.

Our study is the first comprehensive, national examination of the levels and correlates of the public's ability to recognize mental illness in the community and suggest sources of help, setting a baseline to assess contemporary Chinese efforts. METHODS: Data were collected in China as part of the Stigma in Global Context - Mental Health Study (SGC-MHS) through face-to-face interviews using vignettes meeting clinical criteria for schizophrenia and major depression. Our analysis targets the Han Chinese participants (n = 1812). Differences in the recognition of mental health problems were assessed using a chi-square test and further stratified by vignette illness type and urban vs. rural residence. Adjusted regression models estimated the effects of each predictor towards the endorsement three types of help-seeking: medical doctor, psychiatrist, and mental health professional. RESULTS: As expected, recognition of mental health problems is low; it is better for depression and most accurate in urban areas. Perceived severity increases endorsement of the need for care and for treatment by all provider types. Recognition of a mental health problem specifically decreases endorsement of medical doctors while increasing recommendations for psychiatrists and mental health professionals. Neurobiological attributions decrease recommendations for mental health professionals as opposed to general or specialty physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Continued efforts are needed in China to promote mental illness recognition within rural areas, and of schizophrenia specifically. Promoting recognition of mental illness, while balancing the special challenges among individuals who understand the neurobiological roots of mental illness, may constitute a key strategy to reduce the sizeable mental health treatment gap in China.",20190116,19,1,10.1186/s12888-018-1980-8,1471-244X,,

METHOD: A parallel-group, randomised trial was conducted with employees in 2 multi-site Ontario hospitals with the evaluators blinded to the groups. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 group-based education programs: Beyond Silence (comprising 6 in-person, 2-h sessions plus 5 online sessions co-led by employees who personally experienced mental health issues) or Mental Health First Aid (a standardised 2-day training program led by a trained facilitator). Participants completed baseline, post-group, and 3-mo follow-up surveys to explore perceived changes in mental health knowledge, stigmatized beliefs, and help-seeking/help-outreach behaviours. An intent-to-treat analysis was completed with 192 participants. Differences were assessed using multi-level mixed models accounting for site, group, and repeated measurement. RESULTS: Neither program led to significant increases in help-seeking or help-outreach behaviours. Both programs increased mental health literacy, improved attitudes towards seeking treatment, and decreased stigmatized beliefs, with sustained changes in stigmatized beliefs more prominent in the Beyond Silence group. CONCLUSION: Beyond Silence, a new contact-based education program customised for healthcare workers was not superior to standard mental health literacy training in improving mental health help-seeking or help-outreach behaviours in the workplace. The only difference was a reduction in stigmatized beliefs over time.

The sample consisted of 261 college students, 115 of which reported experiencing a current problem. Results of a series of logistic regressions revealed that perceived stigma from others (OR = .32), self-stigma (OR = .29), negative attitudes about treatment (OR = .27), and practical barriers (OR = .34) were all associated with a lower likelihood of having sought treatment among students experiencing a problem. Of the five-factor model personality traits, only Neuroticism was associated with a higher likelihood of having sought treatment when experiencing a mental health problem (OR = 2.71). When we considered all significant predictors in a final stepwise conditional model, only self-stigma, practical barriers, and Neuroticism remained significant unique predictors. Implications for addressing barriers to treatment and encouraging treatment seeking among college students are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record",20171110,14,4,10.1037/ser0000157,1939-148X,,

This article explores the potential for interprofessional education (IPE) to emerge as a strategy to reduce mental illness stigma amongst healthcare students and professionals. Most anti-stigma strategies use a combination of knowledge and contact (with a person with lived experience) to change attitudes towards mental illness. Not surprisingly interprofessional educators are well acquainted with theory and learning approaches for attitude change as they are already used in IPE to address learners' attitudes and perceptions of themselves, other professions, and/or teamwork. This article, through an analysis of IPE pedagogy and learning methods, identifies opportunities to address mental illness stigma with application of the conditions that facilitate stigma reduction.

A number of studies in this field have been completed in various parts of the world. The purpose of this study is to explore the characteristics of the help-seeking pathways of patients with mental illness from urban north China at Mental Health Professional (MHP). METHODS: The pathway diagrams, which accounted for more than five percent of patients, were documented for 441 subjects using the translated version of the World Health Organization (WHO) pathway encounter form. The patterns and durations of care-seeking were analyzed in different diagnostic groups. The &#967;2-test and the Mann-Whitney U test were employed, as needed.
