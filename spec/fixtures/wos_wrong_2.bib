Abstract = {{This study was conducted to identify the language learning strategies
   based on academic achievement of boys and girls. The instruments of
   language learning strategies were distributed to 400 students, aged 15
   years old, of single gender schools and co-educational schools. The data
   were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Preliminary
   review of secondary data found that girls' academic achievement is
   consistently higher than boys' academic achievement in Malay and English
   language subjects. Furthermore, the language subject achievement of
   girls in co-educational schools is better than girls' achievement in
   single gender school. Multiple discriminant analysis also shows
   significant differences for all constructs of Malay language learning
   strategies; learning strategies inside the classroom, learning
   strategies outside the classroom and learning strategies prior to
   examination. This study provides an understanding of the trends and gaps
   in language subject achievement by gender and type of schools. This
   study also suggests the needs for creativity and innovation in
   pedagogical practices especially in language learning strategies.}},

   project are used. Multilevel analyses were carried out on a sample of
   approximately 4000 pupils, 330 classes (190 single-sex), 180 teachers
   and 50 schools (20 single-sex). The results indicate that for boys the
   gender composition of the classes has more impact than the gender
   composition of the schools, whereas for girls the gender composition of
   the schools is more important. Boys make more progress for language (and
   not for mathematics) in co-educational classes even after we have taken
   into account the selective nature of the classes. Girls, on the other
   hand, make more progress for mathematics (but not for language) in
   single-sex than in co-educational schools.}},

Abstract = {{We exploit two unusual policy features of academic high schools in
   Seoul, South Korea-random assignment of pupils to high schools within
   districts and conversion of some existing single-sex schools to the
   coeducational (coed) type over time-to identify three distinct causal
   parameters: the between-school effect of attending a coed (versus a
   single-sex) school; the within-school effect of school-type conversion,
   conditional on (unobserved) school characteristics; and the effect of
   class-level exposure to mixed-gender (versus same-sex) peers. We find
   robust evidence that pupils in single-sex schools outperform their
   counterparts in coed schools, which could be due to single-sex peers in
   school and classroom, or unobservable school-level covariates. Focusing
   on switching schools, we find that the conversion of the pupil gender
   type from single-sex to coed leads to worse academic outcomes for both
   boys and girls, conditional on school fixed effects and time-varying
   observables. While for boys, the negative effect is largely driven by
   exposure to mixed-gender peers at school-level, it is class-level
   exposure to mixed-gender peers that explains this disadvantage for
   girls.}},

Abstract = {{Supporters of single-sex schooling believe that separating boys and
   girls, by classrooms or schools, increases students' academic
   achievement. Critics of single-sex schooling believe that gender
   segregation increases students' gender stereotypes and has no effect on
   students' achievement. In this article, we present these rationales,
   focusing on developmental issues that may affect the effectiveness of
   single-sex schooling. We then review the research on the effectiveness
   of single-sex schooling. Overall, findings suggest that single-sex
   schooling is not more effective than coeducational schooling at
   improving students' academic achievement or attitudes. More work is
   needed to explore a broader range of outcomes, examine developmental
   factors that may influence the effectiveness of various types of
   schooling, and communicate results to parents, educators, and

Abstract = {{Publicly funded single-sex schooling (SSS) has proliferated in recent
   years and is touted as a remedy to gaps in academic attitudes and
   achievement, particularly for low-income students of color. Research on
   SSS is rife with limitations, stemming from selective admissions
   processes, selection effects related to socioeconomic status, a lack of
   ethnic diversity among students, and a neglect of boys' schools.
   Addressing those concerns, the current study is a quasi-experimental
   investigation of the academic attitudes and achievement among 11th-grade
   low-income students of color enrolled in nonselective, urban
   neighborhood public single-sex and mixed-sex high schools. Students in
   SSS reported significantly more negative attitudes about English/reading
   compared to students in mixed-sex schools (MSS), while there were no
   differences in math or science attitudes. Data from standardized tests
   indicate that SSS was associated with poorer achievement among boys in
   reading and math but higher achievement among girls on math, science,
   reading, and writing.}},

Abstract = {{Given the mixed results of previous studies on the benefits of
   single-sex schooling, scholars have called for research on differences
   in the effects of single-sex schooling based on student and school
   characteristics. We sought to examine the associations of a range of
   student characteristics with attitudes and achievement among students
   attending an all-girls public middle school in the southwestern United
   States. Predictor variables included demographic factors (i.e., race,
   family income), prior academic achievement, gender stereotyping, and
   gender identity (i.e., gender typicality, peer preferences). Prior
   academic achievement predicted later achievement and persistence in the
   single-sex school. School-related stereotyping was associated with
   success in and connection to the single-sex school; school connection
   was also a significant moderator of the relation between stereotyping
   and academic performance. Gender-typed peer preferences were associated
   with school connection and persistence. Overall, results indicate that
   student characteristics, as well as issues of ``fit{''} with the
   specific school, are associated with students' connection to and success

   pedagogical framework was to promote student interest in the topic of
   algebra through effective teaching of the domain. This paper further

Abstract = {{This paper contributes to debates on the benefits of single-sex and
   co-educational school environments by considering both single-sex versus
   co-educational schools and single-sex versus co-educational classes in
   co-educational schools. Two research studies provide the empirical basis
   for this discussion. One study was a 10-year-long investigation of two
   Australian secondary schools which had been single-sex schools and
   became co-educational secondary schools over a two-year period. The
   second study involved a two-year investigation in an English
   co-educational secondary school where single-sex mathematics classes
   were introduced for one cohort of pupils for five school terms, after
   which mixed-sex classes were reintroduced. Evidence relating to academic
   self-concept, pupil, parent and staff perceptions and academic
   achievement are discussed. Overall, the evidence suggests that
   co-educational environments create possible social/interaction
   disadvantages for girls, but that academic self-concept is not adversely
   affected by transferring from single-sex environments into mixed-sex
   ones.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates reasons for motivational factors, which vary
   internally and externally in a private school's environment where the
   recent demands for learning English language has increased and those
   demands are met by these schools. It is evidently proved that
   motivations of students are always changeable and quite important to
   enhance their learning in the classrooms, on the contrary, it becomes
   challenging for teachers.
   The study employs a quantitative approach for collecting data by a
   survey that has questionnaire aiming to measure the motivational factors
   of the students in single-sex environment and its fruitful results
   related to English language teaching.
   The recent demands for learning English language in classroom
   environment of the private secondary school is analyzed on the base of
   the motivational factors for obtaining the better command of English
   language.
   In this paper, schools' environment was compared within the frame work
   of gender difference in order to find out motivational factors in EFL.
   This study provides some substantial evidences that only all boys'
   school and only all girls' school have positive effects for motivation
   in learning in English language. This study also highlights some of
   these motivational factors relate to the schools' environment and gender
   issues; especially, the gender issues is treated differently.
   Some of academic research indicates that single-sex schools are more
   successful than the mixed sex schools concerning in learning in English
   language. There are other comparative researches on the success of
   private and public schools' success on this issue.
   This paper findings show that whether or not, single-sex schools are
   more effective otherwise less effective in respect of concurrent and
   long term academic achievement. When the study looks at the part of
   motivational factors, such as schools' environment and gender difference
   then it can be summarized more productive and efficient than mixed sex
   educational environment. Therefore, it may be suggested that for the
   good and betterment of teachers and students, educational institutions
   should start to impart only boys or only girls' education separately
   that is conducive to long term academic achievement.}},

Abstract = {{Argued to `raise boys' grades' and `boost boys' academic achievement',
   single-sex classes in coeducation schools is one strategy among a
   plethora aimed at raising standards. This paper explores the experiences
   of teachers in one coeducation post- primary school that sought to raise
   academic performance, particularly among boys, and to improve classroom
   behaviour by introducing single-sex classes. Funded by a local Education
   and Library Board the evaluation took place almost four years after the
   strategy was introduced and in a climate of increasing teacher concern
   with the effectiveness of the strategy. The methods involved a
   questionnaire survey to all teachers in the school and one-to-one and
   small group interviews with teachers responsible for teaching single-sex
   classes. Contrary to its stated aims, the majority of teachers believe
   that, since the introduction of single-sex classes, academic performance
   and classroom behaviour have deteriorated. Findings are discussed in
   terms of teachers' perceptions of the strategy and the importance
   organizational and contextual factors have on shaping teachers'
   attitudes to new initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{Some U.S. school districts are experimenting with single-sex schooling,
   hoping that it will yield better academic outcomes for students.
   Empirical research on the effects of single-sex schooling, however, has
   been equivocal, with various studies finding benefits, disadvantages, or
   no effect. Most of this research is marred because families generally
   choose whether the child attends a single-sex or coeducational school,
   so there are selection effects that create pre-existing differences
   between students in the different types of schools. The research
   reported here capitalized on the case of Korea, where students are
   randomly assigned to single-sex or coeducational schools. Using 2007
   Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) data, we
   applied hierarchical linear modeling to account for the nesting of
   students within schools. Results for eighth graders indicated no
   differences between students in single-sex and coeducational schools in
   mathematics and science achievement. Results from the 2003 MISS data
   replicated the finding: students' mathematics and science achievement
   was unrelated to the gender composition of their school. These results
   call into question whether single-sex schooling has the academic
   advantages claimed by its proponents.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the impact of performance goals on arithmetic

   Hierarchical linear regression and repeated measures ANCOVAs indicated
   that performance goals predicted an increased use of retrieval and

   increased use of retrieval and cognitive strategies were found in
   all-boy groups, but not in all-girl groups. The study identifies

Title = {{Peer relationships and adolescents' academic and non-academic outcomes:
   Same-sex and opposite-sex peer effects and the mediating role of school
   engagement}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{81}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background. The literature has documented theoretical/conceptualmodels
   delineating the facilitating role of peer relationships in academic and
   non-academic outcomes. However, the mechanisms through which peer
   relationships link to those outcomes is an area requiring further
   research.
   Aims. The study examined the role of adolescents' perceptions of their
   relationships with same-sex and opposite-sex peers in predicting their
   academic performance and general self-esteem and the potentially
   mediating role of school engagement in linking these perceived peer
   relationships with academic and non-academic outcomes.
   Sample. The sample comprised 1,436 high-school students (670 boys, 756
   girls; 711 early adolescents, 723 later adolescents).
   Method. Self-report measures and objective achievement tests were used.
   Structural equation modelling (SEM) was performed to test the
   hypothesized model and its invariance across gender and age groups.
   Results. Perceived same-sex peer relationships yielded positive direct
   and indirect links with academic performance and general self-esteem.
   Perceived opposite-sex peer relationships yielded positive direct and
   indirect links with general self-esteem and an indirect positive link
   with academic performance, but mediation via school engagement was not
   as strong as that of perceived same-sex peer relationships. These
   findings generalized across gender and age groups.
   Conclusion. Adolescents' same-sex and opposite-sex peer relationships
   seem to positively impact their academic performance and general
   self-esteem in distinct ways. It appears that school engagement plays an
   important role in mediating these peer relationship effects,
   particularly those of same-sex peer relationships, on academic and
   non-academic functioning. Implications for psycho-educational theory,
   measurement, and practice are discussed.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The effects of single-sex education are hotly contested, both in
   academic and policy circles. Despite this heated debate, there exists
   little credible empirical evidence of the effect of a U.S. public
   school's decision to offer single-sex classrooms on the educational
   outcomes of students. This study seeks to fill this hole. Using
   administrative records for third through eighth graders in North
   Carolina public schools, the paper finds evidence that the offering of
   single-sex mathematics courses is associated with lower performance on
   end-of-grade math exams, and finds no evidence that the offering of
   single-sex reading scores increases performance on reading exams.
   Robustness checks are conducted. While the mathematics results are
   robust to the checks, the reading results fail an important check, and
   the baseline reading results should be interpreted with this in mind.
   Evidence of significant heterogeneity in the effect across schools is
   also presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a lack of scientific evidence supporting the use of single-sex
   education, the number of US public schools offering single-sex education
   has increased. However, our understanding as to why decision-makers have
   implemented single-sex education is lacking. To address this gap, we
   surveyed US public school principals and assessed their attitudes about
   and experiences with single-sex schooling. Sixty-seven principals from
   single-sex schools and 193 principals from co-educational schools
   participated. The results indicated that principals who had experience
   with single-sex schooling tended to have more positive attitudes about
   single-sex schooling, viewed it as more effective, and more often evoked
   gender-essentialist rationales for the use of single-sex schooling than
   did co-educational principals. However, both single-sex and
   co-educational principals noted issues with single-sex schooling. It was
   concluded that single-sex schooling is not a silver bullet to
   educational reform and that when single-sex schooling is implemented,
   one set of issues and problems is substituted for another.}},

Abstract = {{We study the effect of single-sex school on high school student academic
   performance using 10 yearlong panel data on 202 randomized high schools
   in Seoul. Our sample includes all randomized schools during 2000-2010 in
   Seoul. Out of 202 randomized high schools, there are 59 female schools,
   69 male schools, and 74 coeducational schools in 2010. These high
   schools are randomized in the sense that students are randomly assigned
   to one of two types of schools within a school district: single-sex and
   coeducational. We find the evidence that (i) the average scores for
   single-sex schools are higher than those of coeducational schools for
   both all-boys and all-girls schools, (ii) the average effect is stronger
   for all-girl schools, and quantile regression results report that (iii)
   the positive effects of single-sex school are much more significant for
   underachieving single-sex schools, and (iv) the effect becomes
   statistically insignificant for all-girls schools in 60 percentile and
   above while the effects for all-boys schools are significant for all
   quantiles of the score distribution.}},

Abstract = {{In March, 2004, the federal Department of Education issued proposed
   Title IX regulations that promise to provide public school districts and
   charter school organizers considerable flexibility in establishing
   single-sex classes and schools. At the same time, however, as part of
   the No Child Left Behind Act, the Department has called for
   ``scientifically based{''} research to guide educational practices while
   the Supreme Court has ruled that state actors need an ``exceedingly
   persuasive{''} justification for drawing distinctions on the basis of
   sex. The dramatic turnaround in federal policy and the seeming
   inconsistencies in the law have sparked heated debate that has plumbed
   the depths of gender, race, and ideology. Yet both sides concur that
   research findings supporting single-sex schooling are inconclusive. This
   article works through this conundrum, maintaining that social science
   evidence has far more to offer the debate than either supporters or
   detractors of single-sex schooling recognize. To validate that
   assertion, it examines data on academic performance and social deficits
   across gender and race as well as tentative evidence from existing
   programs. Based on these findings, the author draws the critical
   connection among program planning, implementation, and assessment and
   urges educators and researchers to explore a broad range of questions
   and methods both in their search for evidence to inform and guide
   program development and in their efforts to generate new findings that
   will prove instructive if not definitive in measuring the overall
   effects of these programs.}},

Abstract = {{The use of technology in the classroom and its integration into the
   curriculum in the form of Information and Communication Technologies has
   had a major impact on schools and the education system as a whole. It
   has yet to be shown by longitudinal studies over time that the use of
   technology and computers in the classroom has had a major impact on
   academic performance. One of these studies, Sigales, Monimo and Badia's
   (1) research on the integration of the internet in Spanish schools found
   indicators in their research that the use of technology in the classroom
   was scarce and limited in the schools they investigated. Their research
   concluded that there were a number of points that should be worked on by
   the educational community:
   To improve teacher's skills in ICT use.
   Adapt and improve resources and connectivity to the internet.
   Revise school curriculum.
   Too often, discussions of the role of digital technologies for learning
   skate over the wide variety of differences which exist between different
   groups of learners. Often, `the learner' is presented as a single,
   unitary figure defined solely by age; as `children', `teenagers',
   `adults' etc. And yet, there are clearly wide differences in the ways in
   which different groups of children respond to, benefit from, or are
   excluded by specific uses of mobile digital technologies.
   This study focuses specifically on the use of mobile digital
   technologies to enable children in primary and secondary school to learn
   effectively. Its goal is to move beyond some of the hype and marketing
   rhetoric that sometimes characterises this field and to ask nuanced
   questions about the evidence that exists of the role of mobile digital
   technologies in academic achievement.
   Sigales, Monimo, Maneses and Badia's (1) research on the integration of
   the Internet and ICT in Spanish schools has been a starting point for
   this project. They found indicators in their research that the use of
   technology in the classroom was scarce and limited for the majority of
   teachers and students that they investigated. They also found that just
   introducing technology in the classroom did not guarantee pedagogical
   innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Schools create environments in which some sexual feelings, behaviors,
   and relationships are stigmatized, and this may have negative
   consequences for adolescents with nonheterosexual romantic attractions.
   This stigma can lead them to withdraw and disengage from school at a
   critical time of preparation for adulthood, which can compromise
   opportunities for future success. Previous research has demonstrated
   that sexual minority youth report greater levels of school-related
   problems, including a weaker sense of attachment to school and more
   trouble with teachers and peers. This lack of social integration is
   likely to affect their educational success. Data from the National
   Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the newly collected
   Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement study provide the first
   opportunity to fully explore whether and to what extent same-sex
   attracted youth enter adulthood with an educational disadvantage. In
   this study, we examine (1) whether same-sex attracted adolescents have
   lower levels of academic success, (2) if their lower academic success is
   explained by a lack of social integration at school, and (3) whether
   these relationships differ for boys and girls. Results suggest that
   same-sex attracted students, particularly boys, do suffer academically,
   and that this is in part a result of school-related problems and risk
   factors such as emotional distress and substance use; however, a great
   deal of the disadvantage fails to be explained by these factors.
   Additionally, while same-sex attracted boys show poorer academic
   performance, same-sex attracted girls do not, suggesting that gender may
   shape how sexual minority youth experience and respond to marginalizing
   school environments}},

   Four papers provide reviews of the laws, neuroscience, and critical race
   theorizing relevant to single-sex schooling. In addition, two papers
   present sophisticated re-analyses of important data sets on the topic,
   and three papers present new empirical data on non-academic outcomes

Abstract = {{This study challenges an existing controversy, whether there are innate
   differences in competitiveness between boys and girls in general, and
   among the gifted in particular, or whether competitiveness is
   context-sensitive. The specific context examined in the study is that of
   two pullout weekly enrichment gifted programs: one with single-sex
   classrooms, and the other with co-ed classes. The competitiveness of 129
   students was examined in three different areas: motor (running),
   spatial, and verbal tasks. The results indicate that boys performed
   better than girls did in all tasks, with the exception of competitive
   verbal tasks. Girls were more competitive than boys were in verbal
   tasks, and there were no significant differences in competitiveness
   between girls in co-ed environments and girls in a single-sex
   environment. This adds to the literature that views competitiveness as
   task-sensitive rather than gender-dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Using prospective data from an 18-year longitudinal study of a birth
   cohort of 657 New Zealand children, this paper examines the effects of
   single-sex and coeducational secondary schooling on children's academic
   achievement. This analysis showed a pervasive tendency for children
   attending single-sex schools to have greater success in the School
   Certificate examinations, higher Burt reading scores, greater school
   retention, less likelihood of leaving school without qualifications, and
   less exposure to unemployment than children attending coeducational
   schools. However, a substantial amount of this association was explained
   by pre-entry differences in children's academic, behavioural, social,
   and family functioning. None the less, even after control for selection
   processes, children attending single-sex schools tended to perform
   better than their coeducated peers across a number of educational
   outcomes. Possible explanations for these differences are considered,
   including school gender composition, school climate and traditions, and
   possible inadequate control for selection and confounding factors.}},

   self-selected into a language specialization. These results are
   important for policies affecting the gender composition of classrooms.

Abstract = {{In the field of educational effectiveness research, the influence of a
   class' student body on students' individual achievement scores has been
   a popular research interest for many years. Yet, few studies have
   focussed on the effects of class composition on students'
   non-achievement outcomes, and up to now, hardly any attempts have been
   made to summarize the findings of previous studies on this topic by
   conducting a literature review. The current study tries to fill in this
   gap and focuses on the effects of class composition in secondary
   education in terms of ability and gender on students' school well-being
   and academic self-concept. The results of this literature review
   indicate that ability grouping is beneficial for strong students' school
   well-being, but rather detrimental for the school well-being of weak
   students. The reverse holds for students' academic self-concept.
   Furthermore, our results show that single-sex classes are advantageous
   for girls' school well-being and academic self-concept. As for boys, the
   results are inconclusive. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   self-reported questionnaire including several scales: parental and
   teachers' support, competence beliefs, utility-value and achievement
   goals. In general, mixed-design repeated measures analyses of variance
   indicated no effect of the environment or of the interaction between
   environment and time of measurement. Significant time effects on several
   variables indicated a general decline of achievement motivation over
   time. Consequently, the multiplication of non-mixed high schools, as
   proposed by some, would constitute an expensive and inefficient social
   policy, as far as girls' motivation is concerned.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses a distinctive feature of the Irish education system to
   examine the impact of single-sex education on the gender difference in
   mathematical achievement at the top of the distribution. The Irish
   primary school system is interesting both for the fact that many
   children attend single-sex schools, and because these single-sex schools
   are part of the general educational system, rather than serving a
   particular socio-economic group. In keeping with research on other
   countries, we find a significant gender gap in favour of boys, but
   contrary to suggestions in the literature, our results provide no
   evidence that single-sex schooling reduces the gap. If anything, the
   gender differential is larger for children educated in single-sex

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate attitudes towards and achievement
   in science of Form 3 students studying in single-sex and coeducational
   schools in Brunei. The results demonstrated significant differences in
   attitudes towards and achievement in science of male and female students
   in single-sex schools and students in coeducational schools. These
   differences were at moderate level. In single-sex schools, the girls
   achieved moderately better in science than the boys despite their
   attitudes were only marginally better than the boys. However, there were
   no gender differences in attitudes towards and achievement in science of
   students in coeducational schools. The attitudes towards and achievement
   in science of girls in single-sex schools were moderately better than
   those of girls in coeducational schools. Whereas the attitudes towards
   and achievement in science of boys in single-sex schools were only
   marginally better than the boys in coeducational schools. However,
   further research to investigate (a) if these differences are repeated at
   other levels as well as in other subjects, and (b) the extent to which
   school type contributed towards these differences is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigated social and academic outcomes from single-sex
   classrooms in a Tasmanian coeducational government primary school.
   Interviews, observations and surveys formed the basis of the evidence.
   Teachers, parents and children reported positive benefits from the class
   organisation, but these differed according to gender. Staff identified
   increased confidence and higher self-esteem among girls, whereas boys
   developed increased motivation and more commitment to schoolwork.
   Teachers and parents noted that boys' accountability and self-discipline
   improved. Teachers adopted different strategies from those used with
   mixed-gender classes and gained higher levels of satisfaction from
   teaching, attributable to increased children's time `on task'.
   Paradoxically, standardised school testing indicated no increase in
   academic achievements. However, there may be an extended lag between
   establishing changed social relationships and measurable academic
   outcomes, suggesting that if the new class structure is to achieve its
   full potential, it should be established early in primary school and
   continue to adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{This substantive-methodological synergy demonstrates evolving multilevel
   latent-variable models for cross-cultural data. Using Trends in
   International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2007 data for U.S.
   and Saudi Arabian eighth grade students, we evaluate the psychometric
   properties (measurement invariance, method effects, and gender
   differences) of math self-concept, positive affect, coursework
   aspirations, and achievement. Extending the studies of the ``paradoxical
   cross-cultural self-concept effect{''} largely based on U.S.-Asian
   comparisons, country-level differences strongly favored the United
   States for achievement test scores, but favored Saudi Arabia for
   self-concept and aspirations. Latent mean gender differences, of
   particular interest because of Saudi Arabia's single-sex school system,
   interacted with country for all constructs. The largest interaction was
   for achievement test scores; there were no significant gender
   differences for U.S. students (in coed schools), but in single-sex Saudi
   schools, Saudi girls performed substantially better than Saudi boys.
   Consistently with previous (mostly Western) research, but not previously
   evaluated with TIMSS, in each of the four (2 gender x 2 country) groups
   all three outcomes (self-concept, affect, and aspiration) were
   positively influenced by individual student achievement but negatively
   influenced by class-average achievement (the Big-Fish-Little-Pond
   Effect: BFLPE). BFLPEs were similar in size for boys and girls in
   coeducational (United States) and in single-sex (Saudi) classrooms.}},

Abstract = {{This study carries out a comparative analysis of achievement according
   to gender between mixed and single-sex schools in the region of
   Catalonia, Spain, for the subjects of Spanish, Catalan, English and
   Mathematics. After a brief contextualisation, a review of the main
   findings from international studies on differences in results for mixed
   schools and single-sex schools is then presented. We then outline our
   methodology and research-analysis plan. The study has been developed
   around a specific use of results obtained by students over the last year
   of primary school (12 years old) and over the last year of obligatory
   secondary education (16 years). For this comparison, the statistical
   technique of Propensity Score Matching was used. All segregated schools
   in Catalonia were chosen, representing a total of 15, of which 9 are
   girls-only and 6 are boys-only (with a total of 1503 students);
   additionally, a sample was used of 10 mixed schools, similar in terms of
   social make-up, that is, middle- and upper-class students (with a total
   of 1217 students). In general, the results corroborate international
   research. Results indicate that differences in achievement depending on
   gender in segregated or mixed schools are not related to factors of
   school organisation. We also come to conclusions with respect to the
   limitations arising from circumscribing school performance in curricular
   subjects, and to the need to consider further indicators within the
   teaching-and-learning process in terms of gender and emotional
   development; student attitudes and behaviour; self-concept and - most
   especially - teacher expectations, their teaching practices and the
   effects of these on self-concept and single-sex school performance.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING}},
Abstract = {{Integrated approaches to teaching science, technology, engineering, and
   mathematics (STEM) are increasingly being implemented in elementary and
   middle school classrooms, and despite a variety of conceptions of
   integrated STEM, researchers agree that small group activities and
   teamwork play a central role in STEM learning. However, little is known
   about how students participate in the small group portions of integrated
   STEM curricular units. In this study, a microvideo ethnography framed
   within activity theory was used to examine small group interactions
   among sixth-grade students completing integrated STEM activities related
   to the properties of light. Students working in three different small
   groups (all-girl, all-boy, and mixed-gender) were included in the
   analysis. Findings highlight differences in the activity systems across
   activity type (science vs. engineering) and across small groups, with
   students focusing on different objectives for completing STEM
   activities, utilizing different tools as they sought to reach their
   objectives, and dividing labor differently. Findings from this study
   suggest that these students, and girls in particular, were less prepared
   to navigate open-ended engineering activities than highly structured
   science activities. Theoretical and practical implications for
   curriculum development and pedagogical strategies are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated whether the members of adolescents' peer groups
   are similar in terms of their school adjustment and whether this
   homogeneity varies according to peer group type and gender. A total of
   1262 peer group members who had recently moved to post-comprehensive
   education filled in questionnaires measuring their academic achievement,
   satisfaction with their educational track, school engagement, and school
   burnout. They also gave positive peer nominations on the basis of which
   360 peer groups were identified and categorized as cliques, loose
   groups, and isolate dyads. The results showed that the members of
   adolescents' peer groups particularly resembled each other in terms of
   academic achievement. Moreover, the members of girls' cliques showed
   greater similarity to each other in terms of their satisfaction with
   educational track and school engagement than did the members of girls'
   loose groups. Girls' isolate dyads were, in particular, at risk for low
   adjustment at school.}},

Abstract = {{National data reveals an alarming pattern of continued underachievement
   of Malaysian boys in schools and tertiary levels. Research on the
   single-sex classroom shows improved boys' performance in English and
   foreign languages, and girls' performance in math and science. This
   study reports the experiences of 30 secondary students enrolled in
   single gender schools. The study reveals that in gender separate
   classroom students have higher motivation and confidence levels,
   offering better educational opportunities. This paper proposes the
   introduction of boys' only language classes using an enhanced curriculum
   for boys and the addition of brain based differences in teacher training
   and curriculum development. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   The study found that teachers initiated most of the incidents in six
   categories of sexism.  Furthermore, although the frequency of incidents
   was similar in the three types of schools, the forms of sexism were
   different.  Chemistry classes were the major locus of sexism in
   coeducational schools, and the severest form of sexism was found in
   boys' schools.  Although girls' schools exhibited the most gender-equity
   events, they also perpetuated a pernicious form of sexism:  academic
   dependence and nonrigorous instruction.  Schools with policies that
   actively promoted gender equity in enrollment, in the hiring of faculty,
   and in personal relations were the least likely sites of sexism.}},

Abstract = {{Continued controversy in the United States over the relation of school
   gender composition to student outcomes is partially due to the failure
   to reach consensus on how to evaluate the research and the conclusions
   to be drawn from the research. In this review we examine major problems
   in the available research on single-sex schools, in terms of both theory
   and methodology. We critically examine the major review done by Mael et
   al. (2005) and identify serious problems in studies under review and the
   review methods. Drawing from both U.S. and non-U.S. samples, a subset of
   outcome measures (mathematical performance, verbal performance,
   self-esteem or self-concept) were analyzed using meta-analytic
   techniques. No significant effects for school gender composition were
   observed for either mathematical performance or self measures. There was
   a small advantage observed on verbal performance for students in
   single-sex schools, but in this comparison there was a strong relation
   between the direction of the effect on the outcome measure and
   pre-existing differences. For the three comparisons combined,
   preexisting student differences in SES or cognitive performance revealed
   advantages to students in single-sex schools. In conjunction with
   research showing that control of preexisting differences reduces or
   removes single-sex school advantages, this review provides support for
   the position that single-sex schools may offer no advantage to student
   cognitive performance or social development, but rather may reflect the
   consequences of a more select and advantaged student population.}},

Abstract = {{The study described in this article examined the effect of school gender
   organization-whether it is a boys' school, girls' school, or
   coeducational school-on gender differences in teachers' perceptions of
   organizational control. The study was conducted in U.S. independent
   schools, both because of the variety of gender organization in these
   schools and because of the tendency for independent school teachers to
   have more organizational influence than their counterparts in public
   schools. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) methods were used to analyze
   a sample of 629 mathematics and English teachers in a stratified,
   nationally representative sample of 60 independent secondary schools. In
   coeducational schools and boys' schools, male teachers perceived greater
   influence over school policies outside of the classroom than did female
   teachers. These gender differences were especially great in
   coeducational schools. In girls' schools the trend was reversed,
   however, with female teachers experiencing greater influence than male
   teachers. These findings provide insight into school organizational
   factors, especially single-sex grouping, that either inhibit or
   facilitate the empowerment of women teachers.}},

Abstract = {{Parents can profoundly influence the long-term academic success of their
   children. Parental involvement with their children's schools has
   consistently been associated with much better long-term academic and

   and unwelcome in schools. In order to extend the research supporting
   parent practices and strong family-school collaboration, the present
   study used the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort
   (ECLS-K) data set to examine the following: (1) How same-sex families
   compare to heterosexual families with respect to the parental practices
   of helping and communicating; (2) How home-school partnerships compare
   across same-sex and heterosexual families; and (3) Whether a strong
   home-school partnership is more important for the academic achievement
   and social adjustment of children with same-sex parents given the
   societal context in which these children are embedded. Results indicated
   that same-sex and heterosexual parents did not differ with respect to
   their parent practices or home-school partnerships. Further, home-school
   partnerships were not differentially important for children with
   same-sex parents.}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Previous research on consequences of schools' gender composition has
   mostly investigated students' socio-emotional well-being and
   achievement, while students' academic attitudes and behavioural outcomes
   - including school deviancy - have been studied less. Moreover, most
   studies compared single-sex and coeducational schools, and did not focus
   on the proportion of girls at school. Starting from reference group
   theory, we hypothesise that boys attending schools with a higher
   proportion of girls adopt the latter's positive study attitudes,
   rendering them less susceptible to disruptive behaviour. Conversely,
   girls in schools with more boys are expected to adopt the latter's
   negative study attitudes, consequently being more likely to misbehave.
   Multilevel analyses on data from the Flemish educational assessment,
   consisting of 5961 girls and 5638 boys in 81 schools, showed that both
   boys and girls valued studying more and were less likely to misbehave at
   school when proportionally more girls attended their school.
   Implications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This article examines the role social science has played in
   litigation involving public single-sex educational programs. It also
   explores a body of social science research related to gender and
   education that we believe could assist the courts and school leaders in
   better examining the possibilities and the limitations of single-sex
   programs in the public sector. Specifically, we want to show how a
   particular set of social science research at the intersection of gender
   and education, from a range of theoretical frameworks, could assist
   school leaders in demonstrating to the courts that a justification for
   single-sex programs may exist in current empirical research. Method:
   This article uses traditional legal research methods, which is a form of
   historical-legal research used to investigate the interpretation of law.
   We used the two major legal databases (i.e., Lexis-Nexis, Westlaw) to
   determine how many lawsuits have been initiated as a result of the
   amendments to the Title IX regulations. The retrieved cases were coded
   to determine the legal claims relied upon by plaintiffs and to learn
   if/how social science research was considered in these cases. Findings:
   We analyzed four schools currently involved in litigation. We report the
   social science that was relied upon by school districts and analyzed by
   courts. Implications: We encourage school leaders and the courts to
   explore more diverse theoretical frameworks related to gender and
   education that we believe could add some analytic strength to the
   existing body of empirical research about single-sex schooling.}},

Abstract = {{The United States has made a significant effort and investment in STEM
   education, yet the size and the composition of the STEM workforce
   continues to fail to meet demand. It is thus important to understand the
   barriers and factors that influence individual educational and career
   choices. In this article, we conduct a literature review of the current
   knowledge surrounding individual and gender differences in STEM
   educational and career choices, using expectancy-value theory as a
   guiding framework. The overarching goal of this paper is to provide both
   a well-defined theoretical framework and complementary empirical
   evidence for linking specific sociocultural, contextual, biological, and
   psychological factors to individual and gender differences in STEM
   interests and choices. Knowledge gained through this review will
   eventually guide future research and interventions designed to enhance
   individual motivation and capacity to pursue STEM careers, particularly
   for females who are interested in STEM but may be constrained by
   misinformation or stereotypes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The introduction of single-sex classes within co-educational schools is
   a strategy adopted by some schools to enhance the learning experiences
   of either the girls or the boys depending upon the educational climate
   of the time. In a period dominated by the `what about the boys?' debate,
   this strategy is currently being introduced and advocated in a number of
   schools in an attempt to raise boys' achievement. This article explores
   the value of introducing single-sex classes within co-educational
   schools, and in doing so, it draws upon the perspectives of girls and
   boys involved in one such initiative. The article concludes that
   girls-only classes may have positive effects for girls. However,
   curriculum-as-usual boys' classes do nothing to challenge the
   problematic macho male cultures inherent in schools; indeed, it may be
   the case that they actually exacerbate them.}},

   proposed, although there is relatively little clear empirical support
   for these beneficial results. Much of the cited research is based on
   elite all-female institutions or on parochial schools. This study takes
   advantage of the change of a private, nonparochial school from all girls
   to both sexes. Longitudinal data from grades 2 through 12 were collected
   over the course of the academic year to study the results of this
   transition. Stereotyping declined with age and over time in both types
   of classrooms. Girls in single-sex classrooms showed some tendency to be
   more stereotyped in their perceptions of mixed-sex classrooms than did
   the girls who were actually in that setting. Thus, none of the measures
   showed any significant increase over time in stereotyping among girls in
   mixed-sex classes. Implications of these findings are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of gender peer effects has been well-documented, yet
   regarding estimates that are best-suited for policy formation, the
   literature finds somewhat mixed results. This article builds on the
   gender peer effects literature in a number of ways. First, we focus on
   early elementary school students, for which fewer studies exist. We also
   test whether effects in early elementary grades are subject-specific.
   Contrary to findings for older grade levels, we find that estimates by
   gender are subject-specific for the early elementary grades. Second,
   previous studies using similar estimation have focused on very different
   geographical areas, while this study makes use of nationally
   representative elementary school data for the United States. Third, we
   explore whether effects vary across grades, for which the existing
   literature finds mixed results. We find that the negative
   subject-specific effects of having a higher proportion of boys in the
   classroom increases in magnitude across grades, with insignificant
   effects in kindergarten, negative and significant by first grade, and
   larger negative and significant effects by third grade. Our findings
   suggest that a more balanced gender mix in the classroom is optimal for
   both reading and math comprehension for both boys and girls. However,
   regarding math performance, there is also suggestive evidence that a
   100\% separation of genders could improve girls' math performance
   without consequences for boys' math performance, motivating further
   research into single-gender subject-specific instruction.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundFriendships play an important role in the development of
   school involvement and academic performance during adolescence. This
   study examined the interdependence of depressive symptoms, school
   involvement, and academic performance between adolescent same-sex
   friends.
   AimsUsing cross-sectional data, we examined whether the link between
   depressive symptoms and academic performance would be mediated by school
   involvement at the intrapersonal (actor) and interpersonal (partner)
   levels.
   SampleData came from 155 pairs of same-sex adolescent friends (80 boys;
   M-age=16.17, SD=0.44). The actor-partner interdependence model was used
   to examine the dyadic data and mediation hypotheses.
   ResultsMediated actor effects showed that adolescents who had more
   depressive symptoms reported lower academic performance, and such an
   association was mediated by their own and their friend's lower school
   involvement. Mediated partner effects showed that adolescents who had
   more depressive symptoms also had a friend with lower academic
   performance, and such an association was mediated by both individuals'
   lower school involvement.
   ConclusionsThis study provided evidence to support the broader
   interpersonal framework for understanding school involvement and
   academic performance. The current findings also have potential practical
   implications, especially for programmes targeted at addressing
   adolescents' school problems.}},

Abstract = {{In this analysis, single-sex and mixed schools are compared in terms of
   pupils' television viewing habits, the latter factor being considered as
   an indicator of a pupil's sense of educational responsibilities. It was
   hypothesized that the presumably lower levels of television watching
   among girls attending single-sex schools could be explained by school
   climate factors pertaining to adolescent subculture values and/or to the
   pedagogic approaches of a predominantly female staff. Use was made of
   data from 68 academic-type secondary schools in Flanders (Belgium). Of
   these schools, 25 were mixed and 43 were single-sex (21 girls', and 22
   boys' schools). Respondents were third-year pupils: 3370 girls and 3057
   boys, aged 14 and 15 years. A multilevel analysis (HLM) was performed
   controlling for parental socio-economic status, curriculum enrolment,
   school residency and school mean SES. The results mainly indicate that
   the differential effect of single-sex and coeducational schools on
   girls' TV watching habits may be partially accounted for by factors
   associated with pedagogic approaches by the predominantly female staff

Abstract = {{According to research evidence, self-concept and academic achievement
   are mutually interdependent. Some investigations also found national
   differences concerning the relationship between academic success and
   self-concept. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that
   academic achievement affects different components of self-concept.
   Further, we investigated the possible influence of nationality
   (Slovenia, France) in modifying the relationship between academic
   achievement and self-concept. The results of two-factor (academic
   achievement x nationality) analyses of variance and discriminant
   analyses showed significant correlations between academic achievement
   and various indices of self-concept, which varied in a
   nationality-dependent fashion. The French subjects exceeded Slovenians
   in some domains of self-concept (i.e. verbal, academic, relations with
   same sex peers, relations with parents, religion and spirituality, and
   general self-concept), while Slovenian subjects exceeded French subjects
   in the domain of problem solving and creativity. There was no
   significant difference between both national samples in self-esteem.
   Also, the French subjects exceeded Slovenian pupils in general academic
   achievement. The results were interpreted on the grounds of theoretical
   expectations related to the formation of self-concept and academic
   achievement, as well as on the basis of national differences in the
   school system and personality structure. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, notes from lesson
   observations and video-transcripts of peer-assessment episodes. Data
   analysis suggests that girls' motivation may be supported, both by being
   taught in a single-sex group and by employing assessment for learning
   techniques. However, such benefits were not ubiquitous and may have been
   negated by examination anxiety, inadequate time to adapt to assessment
   for learning strategies, limited negative effects of single-sex teaching
   on learning, the way in which the single-sex class was created and some
   girls' resilient conceptions of science being a masculine subject.}},

   school and 167 Chinese 7th grade students (mean age = 13.09) from a
   secondary school, both located in Hong Kong. Following the Social
   Cognitive Map (SCM) procedure, students were asked to identify the
   social groups within their grades, including their own groups. The
   subjects also rated themselves on multiple domains of competence. Their
   teachers rated them on the same domains. Subjects tended to be biased
   toward self-enhancement when reporting their own groups: They omitted
   members who had low school scholastic rank and unfavorable scores on
   teacher ratings of competence. There was a strong effect of propinquity
   and gentler on group membership, in that all groups were comprised of
   children from the same classroom and virtually all (98\%) of the same
   sex. Members scored similarly on teacher ratings of competence. In
   elementary school, conventional values and academic achievement provided
   the behavioral bases for peer group cohesion. By early adolescence,
   peer-related concerns supplemented rather than replaced conventional
   values as the bases for group cohesion.}},

Abstract = {{Many existing studies find that females perform better when they are
   taught by female teachers. However, there is little evidence on what the
   long-run impacts may be and through what mechanisms these impacts may
   emerge. We exploit panel data from middle schools in Seoul, South Korea,
   where students and teachers are randomly assigned to classrooms. We
   replicate the existing literature that examines contemporaneous effects
   and find that female students taught by a female versus a male teacher
   score higher on standardized tests compared to male students even five
   years later. We also find that having a female math teacher in seventh
   grade increases the likelihood that female students attend a
   STEM-focused high school, take higher-level math courses, and aspire to
   a STEM degree. These effects are driven by changes in students'
   attitudes and choices.}},

Journal = {{RESEARCH PAPERS IN EDUCATION}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Within the Caribbean, there has been a perception that students are
   underachieving in mathematics. This assessment has seemingly been based
   amongst other things upon the proportion of students who are successful
   in mathematics compared to other subjects in external examinations. This
   notion was investigated in a case study of secondary schools in Antigua
   and Barbuda. Statistical data showed that student achievement in the
   examinations was on average lower in mathematics than across all
   subjects, including English language. However, this finding was not
   `true' of students across all school-types, generally a proxy for social
   class in Caribbean settings. In particular, the mathematics achievement
   of students in single-sex schools was not far different from their
   performances in other subjects, but was markedly different from that of
   students in mixed-sex schools. This finding concerning school-type
   suggested at an underlying factor in many students' mathematics
   performance, as school-type in the Caribbean is predicated on students'
   home backgrounds. This paper reports on these findings, and sets out how
   the education system appears to reinforce and further exaggerate
   advantages and disadvantages of students' social and cultural histories.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the Swedish initiative of municipal technology
   centres from a gender point of view. These centres provide after-school
   technology education for children aged 6-16. By means of an ethnographic
   study, the effects of the use of single-sex groups in increasing the
   interest of girls and boys in technical activities have been studied at
   one of the centres. The importance of the gender of the teacher relative
   to the gender of the pupils is also considered. The results show that
   single-sex groups meant different things to boys and girls, and that the
   teachers' way of ``doing{''} femininity and masculinity, respectively,
   in the different groups was of some importance. The results indicate
   that single-sex groups alone do not break down gender barriers. However,
   there are lessons to be learnt from a leisure-time activity that
   provides a different setting from that of single-sex science education
   in ordinary schooling.}},

   concerning the roles of gendered-peer interactions and relationships in
   children's lives at school. We begin by discussing the tendency of boys
   and girls to separate into same-sex peer groups and consider the
   theories and evidence concerning how gender segregation occurs and how
   peers influence children's learning and development. We then turn to the
   important and understudied question of why some children have more
   exposure to same-sex peers than others. We consider factors that
   contribute to variability in children's experiences with gender
   segregation such as the types of schools children attend and the kinds
   of classroom experiences they have with teachers. Finally, we review new
   evidence concerning the cognitive and affective factors that illustrate
   that children are actively involved in constructing the social world
   that surrounds them.}},

Abstract = {{We present findings of a study carried out to determine the effect of

   mathematics. In the study we analysed achievement scores on national
   examinations results for the years 1999 to 2001 of a sample of 1 489
   candidates in four secondary schools in Nakuru District, Kenya. Raw data
   were analysed statistically and the hypotheses tested. Generally, the
   results indicated that streaming based on gender improved overall
   student achievement in mathematics and especially that of girls.
   Although further studies are needed to incorporate this result into
   official policy, there are strong indications that streaming by gender
   may be a useful class environment as an intervention towards improving
   the performance of girls in mathematics in co-educational schools.}},

   98 young children (50 boys and 48 girls; mean age = 54.77 months) were
   observed during the fall semester. At the end of the fall semester, one
   set of teachers reported on children's EC, and at the end of the
   following spring semester, another set reported on children's school
   competence (social, academic, and perceptual-motor). Results revealed
   that EC moderated the relations of children's same-sex play to their
   school competence. These patterns differed for boys and girls such that
   same-sex play was positively related to school outcomes for boys high in
   EC and for girls low in EC.}},

Abstract = {{A co-educational comprehensive school in North Yorkshire, concerned at
   the gap between boys' and girls' performance in French and German at
   GCSE, opted to teach Year 8 languages classes as single-sex groups.
   2003-04 was to be a pilot year, at the end of which pupils' performance,
   motivation and attitude, as well as the experiences and views of
   teachers would be reviewed. The outcome of this review would determine
   whether or not the teaching of French and German in single-sex groups
   would continue.
   It was felt by the Head of Languages that the review of the pilot should
   be informed by an on-going evaluation of the learning and teaching
   experiences of pupils and teachers throughout the year. The review could
   be the first of a number, depending on the outcome of the pilot and on
   decisions made about how long the single-sex teaching should continue.
   This article places the pilot in the context of other research conducted
   in the area of single-sex teaching in co-educational contexts and offers
   some tentative suggestions about the value of this approach and the
   lessons which can be learned from this North Yorkshire school.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effect Science, Technology, Engineering, and
   Mathematics (STEM) Problem-Based Learning (PBL) activities have on
   single-sex classes and how these experiences affect students' attitudes
   toward STEM careers. To close the gap of underrepresentation of females
   in STEM, research suggests single-gender classes should be implemented.
   Single-gender classes have shown to improve female interest in STEM
   fields. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to assess female and
   male interest and attitudes toward STEM fields and careers. There were
   97 participants in 7th through 12th grade who attended a one-week STEM
   Camp. Of those, 50 females participated in an all-female option, 23
   males participated in an all-male option, and 25 campers participated in
   a co-ed option. Participants completed a survey using a Likert scale to
   rate their perceptions of STEM. The results were contrary to previous
   research indicating that both single-gender classes had lower affect
   toward engineering than the mixed gender group. Females in the mixed
   group rated their attitudes and interest toward STEM fields and careers
   statistically significantly higher than the females in the all-female
   group in three of the four constructs (knowledge, importance, and
   career). The findings support the inclusion of STEM PBL in classrooms
   because there were no significant differences between the class type
   after participating in a one-week STEM camp. Through the use of STEM
   PBLs, females' interest in STEM careers is equal to male interest.}},

Abstract = {{The current study was designed to examine one possible weight
   stigma-reduction mechanism: school-level weight diversity. It was
   hypothesized that greater weight diversity among same-sex peers at
   school would attenuate the negative association between weight and
   academic achievement. Across 26 urban public middle schools, 5,991
   sixth-grade students (52\% girls) were included: 12\% African
   American/Black, 14\% East/Southeast Asian, 30\% Latino, 21\% White, and
   23\% from other specific ethnic groups. Weight diversity was estimated
   as the likelihood that two randomly selected students would be from
   different weight categories, using Simpson's index. Standardized
   achievement test scores and grade point average (GPA) were used to
   assess academic achievement. Consistent with our contextual moderator
   hypothesis, high levels of weight diversity at school served a
   protective function. The negative association between body mass index
   (BMI) and achievement test scores, as well as GPA (girls only) was
   nonsignificant at schools with high levels of weight diversity. The
   study results offer a potential explanation for inconsistent findings
   regarding body weight and achievement, and a novel methodological
   approach to capture weight diversity in ways that provide new insights
   for school-based interventions.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOR GENETICS}},
Year = {{2003}},

Abstract = {{The study subjected nine elementary cognitive task variables from the
   Cognitive Assessment Tasks ( CAT) and three scholastic measures from the
   Metropolitan Achievement Test ( MAT) to phenotypic and behavioral
   genetic structural equation modeling based on data for 277 pairs of same
   sex monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins from the Western Reserve
   Twin Project. Phenotypic and behavioral genetic covariation between
   certain elemental cognitive components and scholastic performance was
   examined to determine ( a) whether these elemental cognitive components
   contribute substantially to the variance of scholastic performance; (b)
   whether such contributions vary across different domains of school
   knowledge or from specific domains to a general aptitude; ( c) the
   behavioral genetic composition of the elemental cognitive components and
   the scholastic variables; and (d) how the association between the
   cognitive components and scholastic performance is genetically and
   environmentally mediated. The results of the study showed that as much
   as 30\% of the phenotypic variance of scholastic performance was
   accounted for by the CAT general factor, which was presumably related to
   mental speed. A mainly genetic covariation was found between the mental
   speed component and scholastic performance, although each of the two
   variables was strongly influenced by both heritability and common family
   environment. The magnitude and etiology of the covariation were largely
   invariant whether mental speed was related to a common scholastic
   aptitude or to individual achievement measures covering different
   knowledge domains. Taken in conjunction with previous findings that
   mental speed has a substantial genetic correlation with psychometric g,
   and psychometric g has a mostly genetic covariation with scholastic
   achievement, the findings of the present study seems to point to a more
   global picture; namely, there is a causal sequence that starts from
   mental speed as the explanatory factor for both psychometric g and
   scholastic performance, and the etiology of the causal link is chiefly
   genetic.}},

Abstract = {{Whether families and students choose single-sex over coeducational
   schools for traditional reasons or because they value these schools as
   opportunity structures is the focus of this study. In the United States,
   where single-sex education is an option only in the private sector, most
   research on this organizational form has focused on Catholic schools.
   Introducing a new population to single-sex school research, this sample
   consists of the entire 1989 senior class (3,183 students) in each of 60
   secondary schools selected as a stratified random sample of girls',
   boys', and coeducational independent schools. The study considers the
   personal, demographic, and educational characteristics of families and
   students, as well as their reasons for selecting the particular school
   they attend. Because boys and girls may have different reasons for
   choosing schools and because previous research on this topic documented
   differential gender effects, the study examines the question separately
   by gender. A family tradition for private schooling (mostly single-sex)
   and a religious orientation characterize students who select the
   single-sex school option.}},

   coeducation. Specifically, we (a) show that the purported benefits of SS
   schooling arise from factors confounded with, but not causally linked
   to, single-sex composition; (b) challenge claims that biological sex is
   an effective marker of differences relevant to instruction; (c) argue
   that sexism on the part of teachers and peers persists in SS contexts;
   and (d) critique the notion that gender per se ``disappears{''} in SS
   contexts. We also address societal implications of the use of
   sex-segregated education and conclude that factors found to be
   beneficial for students should be implemented within coeducational

Abstract = {{From 1966 to 1972, Flintridge Elementary school located in Windsor,
   Ontario, Canada implemented a short lived gender reform plan to help
   raise boys' achievement. Shaped by a variety of complex historical
   factors and fuelled by a desire for innovation, educators from
   Flintridge Elementary sought to address the educational needs of primary
   school boys by establishing single-sex classrooms, hiring more male
   teachers, and developing a more omasculinisedo curriculum. Drawing on
   articles from the popular media, scholarly journals, annual school board
   reports, and face-to-face interviews with 10 educators directly involved
   in the gender reform, this small scale study reveals the potential
   difficulties and consequences that arise when boy-only settings are
   implemented in schools as a way to address the educational needs of
   boys. This suggests the need for today's educators to move beyond
   outdated, simplistic approaches such as boy-only arrangements in
   addressing the educational needs of boys, in order to help boys not only
   achieve academically but, more broadly, to lead more fulfilling and just
   lives.}},

Abstract = {{A considerable amount of research has documented that the career and
   academic aspirations and choices of children and adolescents are
   gender-typed. In general, boys and girls have different career
   aspirations and career choices, although girls are more flexible in
   their choices. The purpose of our chapter is to highlight a relatively
   under-represented source of influence on the development of gendered
   career aspirations and attainment: the role of peers and peer-related
   processes. In this chapter, we begin with an overview of key gender gaps
   in educational-related behaviors, attitudes, and goals. We then discuss
   some of the literature and guiding theory on peer influences that
   contribute to educational aspirations and achievement and how this body
   of research has often overlooked gender differences. We also present new
   evidence from preschool and elementary school children that identifies
   some of the gender-based influences peers have on educational and
   occupational achievement, interests, and attainment. We argue that the
   gender-segregated nature of children's peer interactions that develops
   across childhood and adolescence sets the stage for many of the gender
   differences in attitudes, beliefs, motivations, and behaviors that
   contribute to gender differences in aspirations and choices.}},

Abstract = {{Recent educational policies have altered scholastic experience. It is
   the contention of the authors that contemporary school experience may
   therefore, for some individuals, be distressing. This study is concerned
   with the identification of stress-related behaviours of sixth-form
   pupils within female single-sex, selective, scholastic environments. The
   sample consisted of 420 girls drawn from two comparable schools. The
   study was conducted using qualitative and quantitative methods.
   Administration of a questionnaire at three intervals within one academic
   year permitted sustained reflection upon responses. The qualitative
   questionnaire findings permitted generation of themes, later
   investigated through focus groups. SPSS was used to analyse responses to
   scaled questions. The keeping of a research diary served to illuminate
   meaning and to capture anecdotal evidence, which is so easily lost
   within a busy school environment. In addition, the opinions of a number
   of relevant professionals were sought. The study concluded that some
   members of the sample population encounter demands emanating not only
   from assessment incidents, but also from a range of other sources
   inherent to the system of sufficient magnitude, duration and intensity
   to engender school-related stress. Within the study the ways in which
   school-related stress may present are identified; these include, for
   example, physical effects, subjective effects, effects upon work and
   effects upon relationships. An evaluation of current relevant support
   mechanisms is offered and recommendations for change are made.}},

Abstract = {{With the introduction of single-sex classroom settings in coeducational
   public schools, there is an ongoing debate as to whether single-sex
   education may reduce or reinforce traditional stereotypes and gender
   roles. In this article we present findings from a study that
   investigated the extent to which mathematics is perceived as a gendered
   domain among adolescent students enrolled in single-sex classes and
   coeducational classes. Further we analyzed the relationships between
   student characteristics, class-type, and teacher variables on students'
   perceptions of gender in mathematics. Findings from this study challenge
   the traditional view of mathematics as a male domain. Female
   participants more frequently considered mathematics to be a female
   domain than the male participants. Male participants, on the other hand,
   typically did not stereotype the mathematics as a gendered domain.
   Results from this study do not indicate, for girls at least, that
   participation in single-sex classes results in a greater propensity to
   stereotype mathematics as a gendered domain than would be the case in
   coeducational classes. This study contributes to the evolving discourse
   and understanding of adolescents' gendered attitudes and beliefs towards
   mathematics-especially in light of stereotyped assertions that have a
   bearing on efforts to promote the learning of mathematics and science.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports the recent experiences of single-sex teaching in 31
   co-educational English comprehensive schools, often implemented because
   of the perceived need to raise boys' achievement. Since it was often
   undertaken on a short-term basis, its effectiveness is difficult to
   evaluate, although some positive aspects were noted in some schools in
   terms of raised achievement levels and increased confidence and
   participation in class. In other schools, however, single-sex teaching
   appeared to have little impact on achievement levels and led to
   increased problems of behaviour management in boys' classes, with mate
   bonding between male teachers and male students reinforcing the
   qualities associated with hegemonic forms Of masculinity. The authors
   conclude, therefore, by suggesting that single-sex classes can provide a
   Positive and successful experience for girls and boys where there is
   strong commitment from staff, a willingness to evaluate and to diffuse
   good practice, but crucially where gender reform strategies are in place
   to challenge any practices and behaviours that reinforce steretiopical
   gendered roles.}},

   differences were found in classes where students had good relationships

Abstract = {{Studies have consistently shown that parental involvement and family
   engagement programs can positively affect the social, emotional,
   cognitive, and academic well-being of children. Nevertheless, research
   has also indicated that many programs are school-based (e.g.
   back-to-school night, parent-teacher conferences), and have historically
   marginalized families with different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic
   backgrounds. While this perspective has been at the core of some
   scholars' works that challenge school-to-home relationships, such a
   critical framework has yet to be fully developed for same-sex parents.
   This phenomenological study invokes a queer theory framework and uses
   interview data to explore such school-to-home experiences for same-sex
   couples by focusing on four sets of gay fathers. Findings indicate that
   the fathers in this study were actively engaged with school-, home-, and
   community-based educational opportunities. Nevertheless, all four sets
   of fathers faced challenges making decisions for their children's
   schooling and navigating their children's education due to their
   two-father households.}},

Abstract = {{A sense of academic competence combines at least 2 forms of gender
   stereotyping: an illusory. glow about performance on specific tasks, and
   traditional gender stereotyping about general perceptions of natural
   talent. Flexible categorization in terms of generality and content
   suggests a multifaceted model of aspects of self-knowledge about
   Mathematics and English (ASK-ME). This paper demonstrates the
   flexibility of the ASK-ME model for adolescents (N = 1,360) in 2 social
   contests (coed and single-gender schools). The forms of gender
   stereotyping combine so that where traditional gender stereotyping was
   reduced at single-gender schools, an illusory glow had more influence,
   One outcome was that boys in single-gender settings expressed enhanced
   perceptions of performance in mathematics and language. Results
   highlight the importance of generality and content in understanding the
   gendered nature of academic self-concepts in social contests.
   Implications are for differential influences on the plans and choices
   adolescents make about work and study.}},

   achievement and area of science. Parents provided information about the
   way children selected and created projects. In both years and in all
   grade levels, boys tended to choose to work in the physical sciences,
   and girls in the biological and social sciences. Peer collaborations
   were exclusively same sex. Achievement and parental involvement were not

Abstract = {{This study investigated girls' attitudes towards science in Kenya. It
   was carried out with 120 girls from four secondary schools in the
   Eastern province of Kenya. These were an urban single-sex (SS) and
   co-educational (Co-Ed) school and a rural SS and Co-Ed school. Different
   schools were chosen in order to explore whether there are any
   differences in attitudes in SS and Co-Ed schools and in schools in rural
   and urban areas. The methodology included the use of both questionnaires
   and focus group interviews. The main aim was to gain insight into the
   extent and depth of students' attitudes towards science. The findings of
   the study showed that the majority of Kenyan girls who participated in
   the study have a favourable attitude towards science. Girls in SS
   schools were found to have a more favourable attitude than those in
   Co-Ed schools, while girls in rural area schools were found to find
   science more relevant than those in urban schools. It emerged from this
   study that the attitudes of Kenyan girls are influenced by their
   perceptions of the relevance of science, enjoyment of studying science,
   perceptions of the suitability of science for a career, and their
   perceptions of subject difficulty.}},

   single-sex, the state system is highly centralized, selection and
   streaming are widely practised, a high proportion of students (25\%)
   attend private schools, and physics is compulsory. The results show
   that: more girls than boys study physics and biology at the lower
   secondary level (ages 11-16); more boys study chemistry; achievement at
   this level is on a par in biology and chemistry; girls achieve slightly
   lower in physics. At the upper secondary level (ages 16-18), almost
   equal numbers of boys and girls study biology and chemistry but boys
   predominate in physics. Girls avoid the option of physics and
   mathematics, a popular choice with boys. Consequently, at tertiary level
   very few girls opt for courses in engineering and prefer to subscribe to
   courses relating to medicine.}},

Abstract = {{The recent concern with the apparent `under-achievement' of boys in
   England's comprehensive schools has led schools to review the potential
   of single-sex classes as a means of improving performance. This paper
   reviews the arguments for such a strategy, in the context of one school
   where such an approach has underpinned the organisation of the school
   through the last three decades. We examine the rationale behind the
   original decision to implement single-sex teaching, consider the
   evolution of the curriculum through time, and discuss the strengths and
   weaknesses of this mode of organisation from the varying perspectives of
   parents, students and teachers. We consider whether the strategy has
   contributed to an improvement in the achievement levels of girls, and
   discuss the extent to which single-sex teaching has the potential to
   have a positive impact in raising boys' performance.
   In reviewing the evidence, we conclude that the single-sex mode of
   teaching in the school is effective in contributing to high achievement
   levels, in many contexts providing a conducive and supportive
   environment for students' learning. We suggest that such groupings may
   offer more advantages for girls than for boys; we argue that the
   potential of the system will only be fully realised when it is
   explicitly recognised that girls and boys do respond differently, in
   certain contexts, to different teaching-learning styles.}},

Abstract = {{Self-concept scales (Math, English, Parent Relations, Same-Sex Peer
   Relations, and Opposite-Sex Peer Relations) from the Australian
   Self-Description Questionnaire II (SDQII) were included in the National
   Educational Longitudinal Survey of 1988 (NELS:88). Mean differences that
   were based on responses by 17,544 (NELS:88) U.S. and 1,147 (SDQII
   normative archive) Australian students were small, and gender
   differences (girls higher for English and Same-Sex Relations but lower
   for Math) were similar for both countries. Structural equation models
   relating mathematics and English achievement scores, school grades,
   self-concepts, and school-average abilities replicated and extended
   previous results that were based on the internal/external frame of
   reference model and the big-fish-little-pond effect. The results support
   the construct validity of the SDQII responses in the NELS:88 data and
   have implications for self-concept theory, measurement, and practice.}},

Abstract = {{Single-sex schooling has been considered in many countries as a way to
   promote student achievement. This paper estimates the mean and
   distributional impact of single-sex high schools on students' cognitive
   achievement, major choice, and test-taking behavior by exploiting the
   random assignment policy adopted in Seoul, Korea. Based on
   administrative data for a period of seven years, I find that, on
   average, the positive effects of single-sex schooling on test scores are
   small, especially when the parental and teacher sorting are accounted
   for. Although the magnitude of the estimated effects is small, I find
   that the effect is relatively larger for students in quantiles 0.5-0.8
   of the distribution of test scores. The impact is trivial, on the other
   hand, for students located at the very bottom and the very top
   quantiles. Moreover, I do not find any differences, both practically and
   statistically, in major choice and test-taking behavior. (C) 2016

Pages = {{311-332}},
Abstract = {{One quarter of the 1958 British Birth cohort attended single-sex
   secondary schools. This paper asks whether sex-segregated schooling had
   any impact on the experience of gender differences in the labour market
   in mid-life. We examine outcomes at age 42, allowing for socio-economic
   origins and abilities measured in childhood. We find no net impact of
   single-sex schooling on the chances of being employed in 2000, nor on
   the horizontal or social class segregation of mid-life occupations. But
   we do find a positive premium (5\%) on the wages of women (but not men),
   of having attended a single-sex school. This was accounted for by the
   relatively good performance of girls-only school students in post-16
   qualifications, not by the wider range of subjects studied by both girls
   and boys at single-sex schools. Men's labour market attainments were
   more closely related to attending private schools and to parental class,
   suggesting that the intergenerational transmission of advantage, while
   not related to coeducation, is related to gender.}},

Abstract = {{In present analysis, an attempt is made to identify perceived social

   girls' and 22 boys' schools). Respondents (3,370 girls and 3,057 boys)
   were 3rd-year students, ages 14 and 15. A multilevel analysis
   (Hierarchical Linear Modeling) was performed adjusting for parental
   socioeconomic status (SES), parental support, academic performance,
   curriculum enrollment, school mean SES, sense of belonging in school,
   and quality of teacher-pupil relationships. Results show that early
   adolescent girls in single-sex schools experience lower levels of stress
   than coeducational schoolgirls do and that this effect is largely
   accounted for by sense of belonging.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study uses logit regressions on a pooled sample of children from
   the 2012, 2013, and 2014 American Community Survey to perform a
   nationally representative analysis of school progress for a large sample
   of 4,430 children who reside with same-sex couples. Odds ratios from
   regressions that compare children between different-sex married couples
   and same-sex couples fail to show significant differences in normal
   school progress between households across a variety of sample
   compositions. Likewise, marginal effects from regressions that compare
   children with similar family dynamics between different-sex married
   couples and same-sex couples fail to predict significantly higher
   probabilities of grade retention for children of same-sex couples.
   Significantly lower grade retention rates are sometimes predicted for

Abstract = {{The genetic influence on the association between contemporaneously
   measured intelligence and academic achievement in childhood was examined
   in nationally representative cohorts from England and The Netherlands
   using a whole population indirect twin design, including singleton data.
   We identified 1,056 same-sex (SS) and 495 opposite-sex (OS) twin pairs
   among 174,098 British 11 year-olds with test scores from 2004, and, 785
   SS and 327 OS twin pairs among 120,995 Dutch schoolchildren, aged 8, 10
   or 12 years, with assessments from 1994 to 2002. The estimate of
   intelligence heritability was large in both cohorts, consistent with
   previous studies (h (2) = 0.70 +/- A 0.14, England; h (2) = 0.43 +/- A
   0.28-0.67 +/- A 0.31, The Netherlands), as was the heritability of
   academic achievement variables (h (2) = 0.51 +/- A 0.16-0.81 +/- A 0.16,
   England; h (2) = 0.36 +/- A 0.27-0.74 +/- A 0.27, The Netherlands).
   Additive genetic covariance explained the large majority of the
   phenotypic correlations between intelligence and academic achievement
   scores in England, when standardised to a bivariate heritability (Biv h
   (2) = 0.76 +/- A 0.15-0.88 +/- A 0.16), and less consistent but often
   large proportions of the phenotypic correlations in The Netherlands (Biv
   h (2) = 0.33 +/- A 0.52-1.00 +/- A 0.43). In the British cohort both
   nonverbal and verbal reasoning showed very high additive genetic
   covariance with achievement scores (Biv h (2) = 0.94-0.98; Biv h (2) =
   0.77-1.00 respectively). In The Netherlands, covariance estimates were
   consistent across age groups. The heritability of intelligence-academic
   achievement associations in two population cohorts of elementary
   schoolchildren, using a twin pair extraction method, is at the high end
   of estimates reported by studies of largely preselected twin samples.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The population of Mauritius consists of 52\% females and
   scientific literacy is seen to be of vital importance for all young
   people if they are to be sufficiently equipped to meet the challenges of
   a fast changing world. Previous research shows, however, that science is
   not popular among girls. This paper explores one of many reasons why few
   girls opt for science subjects after compulsory schooling.Purpose: This
   study investigated the approaches to teaching in four science classrooms
   in Mauritius, with particular emphases on the preferences of girls as
   they learn science.Sample: A total of 20 student interviews and 16
   teacher interviews were conducted in four schools in Mauritius. The four
   mixed-faith schools comprised two all-girl schools (one state, one
   fee-paying), and two mixed-sex schools (one state, one fee-paying),
   within urban, suburban and rural situations.Design and method: 80
   non-participant lessons were observed, of which 60 were science lessons
   while the remaining 20 non-science lessons were in economics, accounts
   and commerce. Group interviews with five pupils in each of the four
   schools were conducted and 16 individual interviews with teachers in the
   four schools gave an insight into the pedagogic approaches used for the
   teaching and learning of science.Results: Transmissive approaches to
   teaching, giving little opportunity for collaborative or activity-based
   learning, were found to be the most important factors in alienating the
   girls from science.Conclusions: There need to be radical changes in
   approaches to teaching to retain young girls' interest in the sciences.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores how middle school youth in a single-sex education

   The paper considers the possibility of transformative acts within the
   rigid boundaries of single-sex education. It draws together theories of
   performance and play to examine how youth read, respond to, and produce
   their single-sex classrooms. In examining the single-sex classrooms as a
   space in formation rather than a rigidly conceived space, the researcher
   sees many instances of students releasing themselves from the
   heteronormative gender binds that shape experiences of their peers in
   co-education classrooms. In the single-sex classrooms, gender is taken
   up with more fluidity and performances that are not solely confined by
   gender binaries.}},

Abstract = {{Trend statistics reveal a striking reversal of a gender gap that has
   once favoured males: girls have surpassed boys in many aspects of the
   educational system. At the same time, the share of female teachers has
   grown in almost all countries of the western world. There is an ongoing,
   contentious debate on whether the gender of the teacher can account, in
   part, for the growing educational disadvantage of males. In this study,
   we use large-scale data from IGLU-E, an expansion of PIRLS in Germany,
   to estimate whether there is a causal effect of having a same-sex
   teacher on student outcomes. We estimate effects for typical `female'
   subjects and typical `male' subjects as well as for different student
   outcomes (objective test scores and more subjective teacher's grades).
   We find virtually no evidence of a benefit from having a same-sex
   teacher, neither for boys nor for girls. These findings suggest that the
   popular call for more male teachers in primary schools is not the key to
   tackling the growing disadvantage of boys.}},

   on the prevalence of mathematics anxiety in adolescents and investigates
   the factors that influence students' mathematics anxiety in mathematics
   classrooms. Participants in the study were Year 9 students (N=415) from
   seven secondary schools in New Zealand. Students were asked to indicate
   their levels of mathematics test anxiety and mathematics learning
   anxiety. Statistical analyses confirmed that girls report higher levels
   of mathematics anxiety than boys. Findings revealed that girls'
   mathematics anxiety increased with school decile, and was higher in
   single-sex girls-only schools. Mathematics test anxiety was a major
   contributor to levels of mathematics anxiety. The article offers a
   number of strategies that schools might put in place aimed at reducing

   which boys aren't doing well rather than assuming all boys are having
   difficulty. Links between the ``boy turn{''} and choice in educational
   markets, single-sex schooling, multiple sexualities, and the
   ``feminization{''} of the teaching profession are also discussed. Not
   surprisingly,. the issues are complex and multi-faceted and hence not
   well served by a ``girls then, boys now{''} approach to conceptualizing

   naturalistic conditions in four diverse secondary schools in Singapore
   over a span of five to six weeks during 2004. These schools included
   single-sex and co-educational schools. The sample provided, within and
   across the schools, different levels of performance in a graded
   situation; multiple teachers and classes; and control and experimental
   conditions for the curriculum implementation. In the quantitative and
   qualitative analysis of the findings, it was found that the LDEP was
   effective in enhancing the narrative writing skills of many of the

Abstract = {{Ten years of administrative data from a diverse, private, top-100 law
   school are used to examine the ways in which female and nonwhite
   students benefit from exposure to demographically similar faculty in
   first-year, required law courses. Arguably, causal impacts of exposure
   to same-sex and same-race instructors on course-specific outcomes such
   as course grades are identified by leveraging quasi-random classroom
   assignments and a two-way (student and classroom) fixed effects
   strategy. Having an other-sex instructor reduces the likelihood of
   receiving a good grade (A or A-) by 1 percentage point (3 percent) and
   having an other-race instructor reduces the likelihood of receiving a
   good grade by 3 percentage points (10 percent). The effects of
   student-instructor demographic mismatch are particularly salient for
   nonwhite and female students. These results provide novel evidence of
   the pervasiveness of demographic-match effects and of the graduate
   school education production function.}},

   Participants were racially and ethnically diverse adolescent boys in
   grade 8 (M-age = 13.05; range = 12-14). The study was completed at a
   public junior high school that offered both single-and mixed-gender
   classes. Data were collected in 2 waves, the first wave in fall of 2010
   and the second in spring of 2011. At each wave, participants completed
   assessments of gender concepts and self-esteem. Standardized tests
   scores from the end of the previous academic year and the end of the
   year of the study were utilized. Results revealed that the boys'
   adherence to physical toughness behaviors in their friendships was
   negatively associated with math standardized test scores and self-esteem
   from Time I to Time II. Indirect effects analyses revealed a relation
   between boys' adherence to emotional stoicism behaviors in friendships
   and math achievement and self-esteem via boys' adherence to physical
   toughness behaviors. Implications of these findings and the links
   between masculinity, boys' friendships, performance in school, and
   psychological adjustment are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The recognition of the fact that school factors are paramount to
   learning, coupled with the need to put out of place the problem of
   senior secondary students' poor performance in physics informed this
   study. The study was undertaken to examine the causal effect of some
   senior secondary school factors as it affects students' performance in
   physics. Hence, the investigators specifically developed and validated a
   school model involving causal linkages between characteristics such as
   school type, gender, teacher's qualification, school principal's area of
   specialization and physics learning resources, and achievement in
   physics (the dependent variable). The sample comprised of: three hundred
   and thirty (330) students comprising of 167 males and 163 females
   Nigerian senior secondary physics students. Twenty schools with
   twenty-two school principals (21 males \& 1 female) and twenty-two
   physics teachers (all males) participated in the study. A multistage
   sampling technique comprising of two stages was employed to select the
   subjects. A stratified random sampling technique was used to select the
   schools while purposive technique was used to select the students, the
   principals and physics class teachers. Three validated instruments were
   used to collect the data while path - analysis and multiple regression
   (using backward solution) were employed for data analysis. The findings
   of this study documented the more parsimonious model, which is effective
   in predicting the senior secondary students' academic performance in
   physics. The results further indicated that two (School Type \& Gender)
   out of the five predictor variables have both direct and indirect causal
   linkages. The implications of these findings for education policy
   makers, administrators and teachers are discussed.}},

   Beliefs about gender differences in math, spelling, physical aggression,

   methods that varied in the extent to which gender was referenced
   overtly. Children who made systematic gender distinctions tended to
   associate prosocial tendencies and success in spelling with girls and

   differences were minimal for math, and those that were seen were
   consistent with same-sex biases. Children who associated positive
   characteristics with girls tended to associate negative characteristics
   with boys. Although results were generally consistent across measures,
   children were more likely to show same-sex preferences when they were

Abstract = {{There are many hypotheses regarding factors that may encourage female
   students to pursue careers in the physical sciences. Using multivariate
   matching methods on national data drawn from the Persistence Research in
   Science and Engineering (PRiSE) project (n = 7505), we test the
   following five commonly held beliefs regarding what factors might impact
   females' physical science career interest: (i) having a single-sex
   physics class, (ii) having a female physics teacher, (iii) having female
   scientist guest speakers in physics class, (iv) discussing the work of
   female scientists in physics class, and (v) discussing the
   underrepresentation of women in physics class. The effect of these
   experiences on physical science career interest is compared for female
   students who are matched on several factors, including prior science
   interests, prior mathematics interests, grades in science, grades in
   mathematics, and years of enrollment in high school physics. No
   significant effects are found for single-sex classes, female teachers,
   female scientist guest speakers, and discussing the work of female
   scientists. However, discussions about women's underrepresentation have
   a significant positive effect.}},

   have the potential to raise the achievement levels of both boys and
   girls and to have a positive impact on the atmosphere and ethos for
   learning, these gains will be achieved only if the initiative is
   developed within gender-relational contexts rather than situated within

Abstract = {{Particularly in the so called ``hard{''} science subjects the supposedly
   equal treatment offered by coeducation in schools proves to be, on
   closer inspection, an extremely subtle form of unequal treatment. The
   syllabus and the modes of behavior of both male and female teachers are
   mainly influenced by the interests, knowledge and abilities of the boys.
   Based on empirical findings an intervention project aimed at giving
   girls a better chance in science was carried out focusing on the initial
   courses of physics in secondary level I (grade 7). Three aspects of
   innovation were involved: (1) development of new teaching units and
   materials based on empirical results on the specific interests and
   experiences of girls; (2) development of strategies to check ones' own
   (teacher's) classroom behavior; and, (3) alternating single sex with
   coeducational teaching vs. coeducational teaching only. The effects of
   the intervention measures are evaluated in a longitudinal design. Gender
   specific differences in interest and achievement in physics will be
   discussed depending on personality characteristics and classroom
   characteristics as well as the developed curriculum and its motivational
   impact. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   separating boys from girls exacerbated the problems of coeducational
   schools while generating additional difficulties and dilemmas specific
   to sex-segregated schools. With the restoration of coeducation in 1954,
   single-sex schooling, and boys' schools in particular, had been
   decisively repudiated. For educators, policymakers, and parents engaged
   in the current debate on sex-separated schooling, this case study
   involving more than a million male pupils can serve as a cautionary tale

Abstract = {{Objective This qualitative study, which was guided by an integrative
   theoretical lens incorporating ecological, intersectional, and minority
   stress frameworks, examined the heteronormative and gendered contexts of
   gay fathers' relationships with other parents in their children's
   schools. Background Parents' interactions with other parents in the
   school environment can be a source of support, connection, tension,
   and/or alienation, and are significant to parents' overall school
   involvement, which in turn has implications for child academic and
   psychosocial adjustment. Little work has examined gay fathers'
   experiences in schools, and with other parents specifically, despite the
   potential salience of their gender and sexuality. Method The sample
   consisted of 40 gay fathers from 20 couples with adopted elementary
   school-aged children (M = 9 years). The in-depth interviews were
   analyzed via thematic analysis. Results Four main themes were evident:
   (a) school environments are heteronormative, homonormative, and gendered
   domains that gay fathers must navigate; (b) parent communities in
   schools are sometimes sites of disconnection, exclusion, and hostility
   around intersections among gender and sexuality, and race and class; and
   (c) parent communities in schools are also environments in which gay
   fathers experience connection, inclusion, and social support despite the
   prevalence of stigma. Conclusion The school parent community is an
   important microcosm for children's academic and psychosocial outcomes.
   These gay fathers, who were actively involved in their children's
   schools, experienced both inclusion and exclusion in this
   heteronormative, gendered context. Their intersections of privilege and
   marginalization reveal the need to change institutional norms and
   advocate on behalf of diverse families in the educational environment.}},

   Using identity theory, I examine links between gender, self-concepts,

   The sample of 433 talented high school students was drawn from 10 SME
   summer programs conducted in 1995 and 1996. The students' interests
   follow common patterns by gender; identity theory helps to explain why.
   Key findings are as follows: (I) On average, girls' self-concepts are
   more like their perceptions of same-sex others than those of boys, and
   more unlike their perceptions of other science students. (2)
   Discrepancies between self-concepts and perceptions of those in
   science-related disciplines are associated with lower interest in those
   disciplines. (3) Discrepancies explain some differences, by sex, in

Abstract = {{Drawing on a number of fields of educational research this article
   argues that girls come to school better prepared to meet its demands
   than boys. Parents encourage different skills in their children, as a
   result girls have more sophisticated communication skills, and are more
   likely to have been encouraged to participate in intellectual tasks than
   boys, who have been mainly encouraged to engage in sports and physical
   activities. These differences mean that girls more readily `engage' with
   school and show intrinsic motivation for academic tasks, factors
   strongly associated with success. Boys, however, are more likely to find
   schoolwork unfamiliar and difficult. Once in school the single-sex peer
   groups favoured by both sexes provide opportunities to improve the
   skills learnt at home to the further advantage of girls. Differences in
   attitudes to gender roles are also apparent at an early age, boys being
   much more conforming to stereotypical gender roles than girls, who show
   much more sex-role flexibility. This conformity may lead boys further
   away from engaging with school tasks either through `fear of the
   feminine' or `fear of failure'. Finally the article considers how
   schools can help all pupils, particularly boys, to fully engage with
   schoolwork.}},

Abstract = {{Although the phenotypic relationship between mathematics performance and
   general cognitive ability has been well established, relatively few
   studies have attempted to examine the nature of this observed
   relationship. The purpose of the present report was to assess the
   etiology of the covariation between mathematics performance and general
   cognitive ability in data from a sample of 555 twins selected for
   learning deficits (310 monozygotic {[}MZ] and 245 same-sex dizygotic
   {[}DZ] twin pairs) and from a sample of 570 control twin pairs (319 MZ
   and 251 same-sex DZ twins). Subtests of the Wide Range Achievement Test
   and the Peabody Individual Achievement Test were used as measures of
   mathematics performance, whereas the verbal IQ and performance IQ scores
   from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised or Wechsler
   Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised were used as measures of general
   cognitive ability. In both samples, results of fitting bivariate genetic
   structural equation models to the data indicated that approximately 90\%
   of the variability in a latent factor for math performance and 80\% of
   that from general cognitive ability were due to genetic effects. In
   addition, almost 90\% of the phenotypic correlation between math
   performance and general cognitive ability was due to heritable
   influences in both samples. Thus, the phenotypic relationship between
   mathematics performance and general cognitive ability latent factors is
   due primarily to genetic influences. (C) 2000 Society for the Study of

   Therefore, it is crucial to identify factors that promote or inhibit

   socioeconomic status (SES; parental education and income) as possible
   predictors of 2 types of self-regulation in Norwegian children:
   individual behavioral regulation (assessed directly using the
   Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders task) and classroom behavioral regulation
   (rated by teachers using the Survey of Early School Adjustment). A total
   of 243 children age 5 (85\% of those invited) participated. Results
   indicated that Norwegian girls outperformed boys in both types of
   behavioral regulation. In addition, parental SES related positively to
   girls' individual behavioral regulation but not boys'. Practice or
   Policy: The present study supports the idea that boys may be vulnerable
   to low individual and classroom behavioral regulation in certain
   contexts and cultures and that parental SES may influence girls' and
   boys' individual behavioral regulation differently. Future research and

Abstract = {{Introduction: The main purpose of the present research was to compare
   learning strategies used by successful and unsuccessful students.
   Material and methods: Six hundred and five third-year students were
   randomly selected from all-girl high schools in Tehran based on their
   level of academic achievement. The students were enrolled in one of
   three groups: the Mathematics group (which included Math and Physics),
   the Experimental Sciences group (Biology and Chemistry), or the
   Humanities Group (Sociology and History). The very highest and lowest
   achieving students in each of these groups were compared (using t-tests
   and discriminant analysis) for their use of four learning strategies:
   Rehearsal, Elaboration, Organization, and Comprehension Monitoring.
   Results: In each of the three groups, there were significant differences
   between the successful and unsuccessful students in the use of learning
   strategies. In all three groups, high achieving students relied more
   than low achieving students on Comprehension Monitoring, but there was
   no difference in the use of Rehearsal. There was a difference between
   groups in the use of Elaboration or Organization. In the Mathematics and
   the Humanities groups, high achieving students relied more than low
   achieving students on Elaboration, whereas in the Experimental Sciences
   group, high achieving students relied more on Organization. Moreover,
   discriminant analysis showed that the use of Elaboration by students in
   the Mathematics and Humanities groups and Comprehension Monitoring by
   students in the Experimental Science group contributed most to
   educational achievement.
   Conclusions: Learning strategies make a difference for academic
   achievement. Therefore, we must familiarize ourselves with a variety of
   learning strategies, learn them and teach them to our students, and we
   should attempt to change the idea that students can discover strategies
   by themselves in order to help our children grow to their fullest
   potential and prosper.}},

Abstract = {{Body dissatisfaction is now recognized as having considerable negative
   impact on social, psychological, and physical health, particularly in
   adolescent girls. Consequently, we have developed a six-session
   co-educational body image intervention (Happy Being Me Co-educational)
   designed to reduce body dissatisfaction and its risk factors in Grade 7
   girls. In addition to evaluating the program's efficacy, we aimed to
   identify whether girls would benefit equally when it was delivered as a
   universal intervention to a whole class including both boys and girls
   (co-educational delivery), or delivered as a selective intervention to
   girls only (single-sex delivery). Participants were 200 Grade 7 girls
   from five schools in Melbourne, Australia. Schools were randomly
   allocated to receive the intervention in single-sex classes (n = 74),
   co-educational classes (n = 73), or participate as a no -intervention
   control (n = 53). Girls completed self-report assessments of body
   dissatisfaction, psychological (internalization of the thin ideal,
   appearance comparison, and self-esteem) and peer environment (weight
   -related teasing and appearance conversations) risk factors for body
   dissatisfaction, and dietary restraint, at baseline, post -intervention,
   and at 6-month follow-up. Significant improvements in body
   dissatisfaction and psychological risk factors were observed in the
   intervention group at post -intervention and these were maintained at
   follow-up for psychological risk factors. Importantly, no significant
   differences between universal and selective delivery were observed,
   suggesting that the intervention is appropriate for dissemination in
   both modes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the school motivation of LGB (lesbian, gay, and
   bisexual) students in Flanders, the northern part of Belgium, a fairly
   LGB-friendly country. The authors hypothesize that LGB students in
   Flemish secondary schools are less motivated for school than
   heterosexual students because they experience less sense of school
   belonging and more discrimination. In addition, the authors investigate
   minority-specific factors that could influence the school motivation of
   LGB students. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses are performed on
   data from 1,745 secondary school students. The impact of minority
   stressors on the school motivation of LGB students is examined with
   hierarchical multiple regression analyses on data from 162 LGB students.
   Both analyses show that lesbian girls are less motivated to perform in
   school, but sense of belonging, perceived discrimination, and minority
   stressors do not explain this finding. Alternative explanations for
   these results and implications for further research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Relevancy, or how learners perceive science and technology (S\&T) as
   important to their current and future lives, has grown in importance
   internationally. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of
   The Bahamas has stated that cultivating students' science relevancy for
   all students, regardless of gender (male/female), or socioeconomic
   factors (SES) like location (rural/urban) or type (public/private) of
   K-12 schooling, is vital to national development. This study presents
   findings from a 2018-2019 sampling of 1105 secondary students from
   co-educational public and private schools in both rural and urban areas
   among the inhabited major and minor islands of The Bahamas to explore
   Bahamian students' science interests and what factors they find
   attractive in careers by variables of gender and SES. Using data from
   four batteries of the ROSE questionnaire querying students' science
   interests and attributes desirable in a future career, independent
   sample t-tests revealed significant differences for gender and school
   type in both categories. Further, item level Mann-Whitney U analyses
   revealed nuanced significant differences in regard to gendered science
   interests and desired attributes of a future career with far fewer
   significant differences by SES factors. This baseline of science
   relevancy provides insight to strategies for enhancing Bahamian
   students' S\&T experience.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we provide a rigorous review of evaluations of education
   programmes in developing countries. This review is organised to provide
   guidance to policy-makers by identifying education interventions that
   are effective, sometimes effective, and not effective and by presenting
   some information on the cost effectiveness of different types of
   interventions. We distinguish between interventions' impacts on two
   types of outcomes: time in schools and learning as measured by test
   scores. Regarding children's time in school, we find that there are two
   effective, but admittedly relatively expensive, ways to increase
   enrolment and attendance: (1) Providing cash transfers conditional on
   attendance; and (2) Building new schools in communities where schools
   either do not exist or are far away. We have identified four
   interventions that have been shown to be effective at increasing test
   scores: (1) Merit-based student scholarships; (2) Teaching at the right
   level; (3) Decreasing pupil-teacher ratios; and (4) Building new
   schools.}},

   mixed-sex/ethnicity (n = 113), single-sex (n = 122), and minority-only
   (n = 148) classrooms. After controlling for socioeconomic status, the
   moderation analyses indicated that participants with a chronic need to
   belong in classes with diversity (mixed sex/ethnicity) perceived higher
   social acceptance, while those with a chronic need to belong in
   homogeneous classes (single-sex and minority-only) reported greater
   feelings of rejection. Upward comparison for differentiation was found
   to influence the indirect effects of the need to belong on feelings of
   rejection and depression in single-sex and minority-only classes. In
   particular, the mediating effect of upward comparison was stronger in

Abstract = {{Children in traditional families (i.e., married, 2 biological parents)
   tend to do better than their peers in nontraditional families. An
   exception to this pattern appears to be children from same-sex parent
   families. Children with lesbian mothers or gay fathers do not exhibit
   the poorer outcomes typically associated with nontraditional families.
   Studies of same-sex parent families, however, have relied on a static
   conceptualization of the family and discounted the importance of the
   timing and number of family transitions for understanding children's
   outcomes. To examine whether same-sex parent families represent an
   exception among nontraditional families, the author used data from the
   Early Childhood Longitudinal StudyKindergarten cohort (N = 19,043) to
   create a dynamic indicator of children's family structure and tested its
   association with math assessment scores. The results indicated that
   children in same-sex parent families scored lower than their peers in
   married, 2-biological parent households, but the difference was
   nonsignificant net of family transitions.}},

Abstract = {{Sex differences in mathematical ability were examined in a nation-wide
   sample of 32,346 Jordanian 4th graders (age 9-10 year) on a 40-item
   mathematics test. Overall, boys were found to perform slightly worse (d
   = -0.12) but had slightly more variation in scores (SD = 1.02 and SD =
   0.98 for boys and girls, respectively). However, when results were
   disaggregated by school type, single-sex versus coed (i.e.,
   coeducational), boys were found to perform better than girls in coed
   schools (d = 0.27) but worse across single-sex schools (d = -0.37).
   Two-parameter item response theory analysis showed that item difficulty
   was similar across sexes in the full sample. Item loadings exhibited
   substantial departure from measurement invariance with respect to boys
   and girls at single-sex schools, though. For boys and girls at coed
   schools, both the item difficulty and item Loading correlations were
   highly similar, evincing that measurement invariance Largely held in
   this case. Partially consistent with findings from other countries, a
   correlation between item difficulty and male advantage was observed, r =
   .57, such that the relative male advantage increased with increased item
   difficulty. Complicating interpretation, this association did not
   replicate within coed schools. Item content, Bloom's cognitive taxonomy
   category, and item position showed no relation to sex differences.}},

Abstract = {{Not all adolescents with school attendance problems attribute their
   behavior to the same causes. Knowing the subtypes of students who reject
   school and their relationship with new variables, such as self-concept,
   is an unresolved task. This study aimed to identify different school
   refusal behavior profiles and to determine whether these profiles
   differed from each other based on the scores of the eleven dimensions of
   self-concept (Physical appearance, Physical abilities, Parent relations,
   Same-sex relations, Opposite-sex relations, Honesty, Emotional
   stability, Self-esteem, Verbal, Math, and General school). The
   participants were 1315 Spanish students (57.6\% male) aged 12-18 years
   (M = 15.21; SD = 1.74). The School Refusal Assessment Scale-Revised and
   the Self-Description Questionnaire II-Short Form were administered. A
   latent class analysis revealed four school refusal behavior profiles:
   Moderately High School Refusal Behavior, Moderately Low School Refusal
   Behavior, Mixed School Refusal Behavior and Non-School Refusal Behavior.
   The results indicated that the Mixed School Refusal Behavior group was
   the most maladaptive profile and revealed the lowest mean scores on
   self-concept. In contrast, Non-School Refusal and Moderately Low School
   Refusal Behavior groups revealed the highest scores in all dimensions of
   self-concept. Implications for working toward the prevention of school
   refusal in students with low self-concept are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Overestimation and underestimation of students' own competence result
   from social comparison in the classroom. There is some evidence that
   secondary school students compare their results with those of one or two
   same-sex others who perform slightly better than themselves. The first
   objective of this study was to replicate these findings among younger
   students (9-11 years old) in mathematics and language arts (French). The
   second objective was to consider the identification with the target as a
   moderator factor, because findings have been divergent regarding the
   positive or negative influence of social comparison on students'
   academic self-evaluation. We expected firstly that absolute upward
   comparison to be beneficial for students' self-evaluation bias of
   competence provided they identified with their upward target. Secondly,
   we expected their perception of their target's competence (relative
   comparison) to contribute to students' self-evaluation bias of
   competence and to be negatively related to it. The results indicated a
   tendency to compare upward and revealed that absolute upward comparison
   was positively related to the students' self-evaluation bias of
   competence in mathematics and French. This relationship was stronger
   when the students identified with their upward target. In contrast,
   relative comparison was negatively related to their self-evaluation bias
   of competence in mathematics and French. To sum up, these results reveal
   the need to consider identification with the comparison target when
   studying the relationship between social comparison and academic
   self-evaluation and to consider relative and absolute comparison
   simultaneously in order to bring out the full contribution of social
   comparison in the classroom.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Establishing or preserving single-sex schooling has been
   widely discussed as a way of bringing more girls into the natural
   sciences.
   Aims. We test the assumption that the beneficial effects of single-sex
   education on girls' self-concept of ability in masculine subjects such
   as physics are due to the lower accessibility of gender-related
   self-knowledge in single-sex classes.
   Sample. N = 401 eighth-graders (mean age 14.0 years) from coeducational
   comprehensive schools.
   Methods. Random assignment of students to single-sex vs. coeducational
   physics classes throughout the eighth grade. At the end of the year,
   students' physics-related self-concept of ability was measured using a
   questionnaire. In a subsample of N = 134 students, the accessibility of
   gender-related self-knowledge during physics classes was assessed by
   measuring latencies and endorsement of sex-typed trait adjectives.
   Results. Girls from single-sex physics classes reported a better
   physics-related self-concept of ability than girls from coeducational
   classes, while boys' self-concept of ability did not vary according to
   class composition. For both boys and girls, gender-related
   self-knowledge was less accessible in single-sex classes than in
   mixed-sex classes. To the extent that girls' feminine self-knowledge was
   relatively less accessible than their masculine self-knowledge, their
   physics-related self-concept of ability improved at the end of the
   school year.
   Conclusions. By revealing the importance of the differential
   accessibility of gender-related self-knowledge in single- and mixed-sex
   settings, our study clarifies why single-sex schooling helps adolescents
   to gain a better self-concept of ability in school subjects that are
   considered inappropriate for their own sex.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundWomen in mathematical domains may become attuned to
   situational cues that signal a discredited social identity, contributing
   to their lower achievement and underrepresentation.
   AimThis study examined whether heightened in-group representation
   alleviates the effects of stereotype threat on women's mathematical
   performance. It further investigated whether single-sex testing
   environments and stereotype threat influenced participants to believe
   that their ability was fixed (fixed mindset) rather than a trait that
   could be developed (growth mindset).
   Sample and methodOne hundred and forty-four female participants were
   assigned randomly to a self-as-target or group-as-target stereotype
   threat condition or to a control condition. They completed a modular
   arithmetic maths test and a mindset questionnaire either alone or in
   same-sex groups of 3-5 individuals.
   ResultsParticipants solved fewer mathematical problems under
   self-as-target and group-as-target stereotype threat when they were
   tested alone, but these performance deficits were eliminated when they
   were tested in single-sex groups. Participants reported a weaker growth
   mindset when they were tested under stereotype threat and in single-sex
   groups. Moreover, evidence of inconsistent mediation indicated that
   single-sex testing environments negatively predicted mindset but
   positively predicted mathematical performance.
   ConclusionsThese findings suggest that single-sex testing environments
   may represent a practical intervention to alleviate stereotype threat
   effects but may have a paradoxical effect on mindset.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research on eating disorders, disordered eating behaviours, and
   whether their prevalence varies across schools, has produced
   inconsistent results. Our previous work using Swedish record-linkage
   data found that rates of diagnosed eating disorders vary between
   schools, with higher proportions of girls and higher proportions of
   highly educated parents within a school being associated with greater
   numbers of diagnosed eating disorders. We aimed to extend these findings
   to a UK population-based sample and hypothesised that a similar
   association would be evident when studying disordered eating behaviours.
   We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to
   test the hypothesis that prevalence of self- and parent-reported
   disordered eating behaviours (binge eating, purging, fasting,
   restrictive eating, and fear of weight gain), and body dissatisfaction
   cluster by school. We had complete data on body dissatisfaction, school
   attended, and other possible risk factors for 2146 girls in 263 schools
   at age 14 and on disordered eating behaviours for 1769 girls in 273
   schools at age 16. We used multilevel logistic regression modelling to
   assess whether prevalence varied between and within schools, and
   logistic regression to investigate the association between specific
   school characteristics and prevalence of disordered eating behaviours
   and body dissatisfaction. At age 14, there was no evidence for body
   dissatisfaction clustering by school, or for specific school
   characteristics being associated with body dissatisfaction. At age 16,
   there was no evidence for clustering, but higher rates of disordered
   eating behaviours were associated with attending all-girl schools and
   lower levels with attending schools with higher academic results. We
   found no evidence for clustering of disordered eating behaviours in
   individual schools, possibly because of the small cluster sizes.
   However, we found evidence for higher levels of disordered eating
   behaviours in 16years in all-girl schools, and in schools with lower
   academic performance.}},

   representative cohort of 7649 individuals born in the United Kingdom
   showed that teenage job aspirations predict specific occupational
   attainments in adulthood. Job aspirations expressed in adolescence
   differed between the sexes, and were related to parental education,
   teacher-ratings and self-ratings of ability, test scores in mathematics,
   and the school environment. Occupational attainment at age 33 was
   significantly related to the job aspirations expressed at age 16, but
   also to the belief in one's own ability, mathematical test performance,
   specific personality characteristics, as well as social background and
   gender. It is concluded that for the understanding of occupational

   adolescents in relation to their sociodemographic characteristics,
   communication skills, and perceived familial social support. This
   cross-sectional research is conducted in the high schools in some city
   centers, in Turkey, in 2013. In this study, cluster sampling was used.
   In each school, a class for each grade level was randomly selected, and
   all the students in the selected classes were included in the sample.
   One thousand seven hundred forty-two students aged between 14 and 20
   years were included in the sample.
   The mean Internet Addiction Scale (IAS) score of the students was found
   to be 27.9 +/- 21.2. According to the scores obtained from IAS, 81.8\%
   of the students were found to display no symptoms (<50 points), 16.9\%
   were found to display borderline symptoms (50-79 points), and 1.3\% were
   found to be Internet addicts (>= 80 points). According to the results of
   the binary logistic regression, male students and the students in single
   sex vocational schools were found to report higher levels of borderline
   Internet addiction. It was also observed that the IAS score increases
   when the father's educational level increases and when the students'
   school performance is worse. On the other hand, the IAS score decreases
   when the student grade level, perceived family social support, and
   communication skills scores increase.
   The risk factors for Internet addiction are being a male, low academic
   achievement, inadequate social support and communication skills, and
   father's high educational level.}},

Abstract = {{Formative assessment is intended to develop students' capacity to learn
   and increase the effectiveness of teaching. However, the extent to which
   formative assessment can meet these aims depends on the relationship
   between its conception and current conceptions of learning. In recent
   years concern about sex group differences in achievement has led to
   policy directives that have required English teachers to reconsider
   their curriculum and their practice. Ameliorating strategies such as
   single-sex groupings and gendered seating are based on common-sense
   beliefs about gender rather than research. Case-study data are used to
   examine the consequences of these strategies for students' literacy
   learning by exemplifying how settings influence the dynamic construction
   of knowledge, and how knowledge and, therefore, what is assessed, is
   legitimated by teachers. Socio-cultural approaches to learning challenge
   dominant conceptions of formative assessment and highlight that
   classroom practices are at once situated and mediated by processes
   beyond the school.}},

Abstract = {{The primary purpose was to investigate the efficacy of a full year of
   single-sex ( SS) teaching of science. The secondary aims were to locate
   any differentiation by set and gender, and to relate these to more
   proximal variables. Participants were 13 year olds. Higher set girls
   gave evidence of clear benefits overall, and higher set boys also,
   except in biology. Lower set pupils performed at or below expectations.
   Analyses of additional questionnaire and interview data pointed to
   further reasons for avoiding the making of unqualified generalizations
   about SS teaching. Pupil preferences for SS teaching were relevant, as
   were gender differences in attitudes to biology and physics. Qualitative
   data suggested higher set girls benefited from more learning-related
   classroom interaction and less interference and exploitation of girls by
   boys in SS classes. Lower set pupils complained that SS teaching
   deprived them of social interaction with the other sex. The concluding
   suggestion was that SS teaching offers affordances of benefits when
   mixed-sex teaching has specifiable disadvantages.}},

   showed significantly more overall disturbance. The boys showed poor task
   involvement in the classroom and more emotional difficulties, conduct

   girls were statistically significant only for emotional disturbance and
   poor task involvement in the classroom. Both boys and girls in long-term

   relationship would be differentially related to adjustment, depending on
   their relations with the same-sex peer group. Three hundred and twelve

   same-sex peers, involvement in reciprocal same-sex friendships,
   involvement in romantic relationships, self-esteem, antisocial behavior,
   and academic performance. Social acceptance by other-sex peers and
   involvement in reciprocal other-sex friendships were also assessed for
   control purposes. The results showed that having a boyfriend/girlfriend
   was related to poorer emotional and behavioral adjustment for those
   early adolescents who were unpopular among same-sex peers. For
   adolescents who were popular among same-sex peers, romantic involvement
   was not related to emotional and behavioral adjustment. Independently of
   same-sex peer acceptance, however, romantic involvement was negatively
   related to academic performance, albeit only for girls. The results are

Abstract = {{There has been a widespread increase in single-sex public schooling in
   the U.S. following 2006 amendments to Title IX stipulated by the No
   Child Left Behind Act. As its inclusion in No Child Left Behind
   demonstrates, single-sex public schooling is viewed as a means to
   improve the educational experiences and performance of low-income youth
   of color. Yet little is known about the effects and efficacy of
   single-sex public education, particularly for these populations. This
   piece provides a critical theoretical review of this issue. It examines
   the three main rationales offered by proponents of single-sex education
   for low-income youth of color, who contend that it will 1) eliminate
   distraction by and harassment from the other sex; 2) address the
   different learning styles of girls and boys; and 3) remedy past
   inequities experienced by low-income populations of color by offering
   them opportunities afforded to more privileged youth. The review reveals
   no documented benefits to single-sex public education for low-income
   youth of color and a number of concerns. Thus, it recommends that policy
   makers reconsider devoting scarce resources to this practice, which
   ultimately has the potential to further marginalize low-income youth of
   color by reinforcing racialized stereotypes of hypersexuality,
   reproducing narrow and restrictive definitions of gender, invalidating
   the experiences and identities of GLBTQ youth, and diverting attention
   from the need to address poverty and racism.}},

Abstract = {{The research reported in this paper outlines the impact of confidence,
   competition, and failure in relation to adolescent girls and leadership
   behaviour. Focus groups were used as the method of data collection.
   These focus groups were facilitated electronically using Skype Instant
   Messaging. Participants were girls from single-sex schools; all were in
   their final year of schooling and currently held a leadership position.
   Students were located in schools across Australia, with one school
   located in South Africa. It was made apparent by this study that girls,
   at times, lacked confidence in themselves and their ability to enact
   leadership. Whilst it was acknowledged that girls had a highly
   competitive nature, especially in the academic and sporting domains, the
   word `doubt' continuously resonated throughout student responses.
   Continued research into this domain will be important in ensuring that
   girls overcome this `doubt' and have confidence in their capacity as
   leaders both within the school context and beyond.}},

   in psychosocial functioning resulted from differences in the quality of
   social relationships. Data were collected from 866 Dutch high school
   students (mean age 13.61 years) by means of a computer-based
   questionnaire. Of the participants, 74 (8.5\%) reported having feelings
   of SSA. The participants with SSA rated the quality of their
   relationships with their fathers and their peers lower than did those
   without SSA. Participants with SSA also had poorer mental health (higher
   levels of depression and lower levels of self-esteem) and lower school
   performance. A mediation analysis revealed that differences in
   psychosocial functioning resulted from differences in the quality of the
   same-sex attracted youths' social relationships, especially with fathers

Abstract = {{This article documents evidence of nonrandom gender sorting across K-12
   schools in the United States. The sorting exists among coed schools and
   at all grade levels, and it is highest in the secondary school grades.
   We observe some gender sorting across school sectors and types: for
   instance, males are slightly underrepresented in private schools and
   charter schools and are substantially overrepresented in irregular
   public schools, a large share of which educates students with special
   needs and juvenile justice involvement. Gender sorting within sectors
   and types is also quite prevalent and appears to be highest within the
   private schools (where single-sex schools are more common) and irregular
   public schools. We find that gender sorting is higher in counties that
   have higher shares of enrollment in private and nonregular public
   schools. This sorting occurs even though parents have similar stated
   preferences for school attributes for their sons and daughters.}},

Abstract = {{Testosterone is an important hormone in the sexual differentiation of
   the brain, contributing to differences in cognitive abilities between
   males and females. For instance, studies in clinical populations such as
   females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) who are exposed to
   high levels of androgens in utero support arguments for prenatal
   testosterone effects on characteristics such as visuospatial cognition
   and behaviour. The comparison of opposite-sex (OS) and same-sex (SS)
   twin pairs can be used to help establish the role of prenatal
   testosterone. However, although some twin studies confirm a
   masculinizing effect of a male co-twin regarding for instance perception
   and cognition it remains unclear whether intra-uterine hormone transfer
   exists in humans. Our aim was to test the potential influences of
   testosterone on academic performance in OS twins. We compared
   ninth-grade test scores and teacher ratings of OS (n = 1812) and SS (n =
   4054) twins as well as of twins and singletons (n = 13,900) in
   mathematics, physics/chemistry, Danish, and English. We found that males
   had significantly higher test scores in mathematics than females
   (.06-.15 SD), whereas females performed better in Danish (.33-.49 SD),
   English (.20 SD), and neatness (.45-.64 SD). However, we did not find
   that OS females performed better in mathematics than SS and singleton
   females, nor did they perform worse either in Danish or English. Scores
   for OS and SS males were similar in all topics. In conclusion, this
   study did not provide evidence for a masculinization of female twins
   with male co-twins with regard to academic performance in adolescence.

Abstract = {{We develop a general class of nonparametric tests for treatment effects
   conditional on covariates. We consider a wide spectrum of null
   hypotheses regarding conditional treatment effects, including the
   following: (a) the null hypothesis of the conditional stochastic
   dominance between treatment and control groups; (b) the null hypothesis
   that the conditional average treatment effect is nonpositive for each
   value of covariates; (c) the null hypothesis of no distributional (or
   average) treatment effect conditional on covariates. The test statistics
   are based on L-1-type functionals of uniformly consistent nonparametric
   kernel estimators of conditional expectations that characterize the null
   hypotheses. We show that our tests using the standard normal critical
   values have asymptotically correct size. We also show that the proposed
   nonparametric tests are consistent against general fixed alternatives
   and have non-negligible powers against some n(-1/2) local alternatives
   to the null hypothesis with inequality constraints and n(-1/2)h(-d/4)
   local alternatives to the null hypothesis with equality constraints,
   where h is a bandwidth, n is the sample size and d is the dimension of
   continuous covariates. We illustrate the usefulness of our tests by
   applying them to the effect of single-sex schooling on academic
   achievements using Korean data.}},

Journal = {{EARLY CHILDHOOD RESEARCH QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{409-418}},
Abstract = {{A multilevel modeling approach was employed to investigate the relation
   between sex composition and developmental change in 70 urban preschool
   classrooms. The research represents a unique contribution as(1) few
   studies have examined the influence of sex composition during the
   preschool years, (2) it represents the first research to use a
   continuous (i.e., sex ratio) as opposed to binary (i.e., mixed-versus
   single-sex) indicator for classroom sex composition, and (3) the sample
   represents an important and often neglected group (i.e., low-income
   children from urban schools). A series of HLM models were run,
   addressing the nested nature of the data (children within classrooms),
   and relating classroom sex composition to developmental change using the
   cognitive, motor, and social subscales from the Child Observation Record
   (COR). Overall, there were no main effects at the classroom-level for
   sex composition. However, a cross-level interaction indicated that,
   while girls' development was not influenced by classroom sex
   composition, boys in classrooms with proportionally more boys fared
   significantly worse in terms of development as assessed by combined
   score on the COR. More specifically, this interaction was significant
   when predicting the COR cognitive subscale, but nonsignificant when
   predicting the COR social and motor subscales. This was true when
   controlling for the number of students at the classroom-level, as well
   as child's age and baseline ability (i.e., Time 1 COR) at the
   child-level. implications for early childhood education policy are
   discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This review of the literature on peer and cross-age tutoring emphasizes
   programs in mathematics and suggests that such programs have positive
   academic outcomes for African American and otherminority students as
   well as for White students who participate as tutors, as tutees, or
   both. Such programs also appear to have a positive impact on a variety
   of attitudinal and socioemotional outcomes, such as students' attitudes
   towards school, their self-concepts, and their sense of academic
   efficacy. This review also explores whether specific features of the
   tutoring programs (e.g., tutor training and amount of tutoring) or
   characteristics of the students (e.g., academic level prior to tutoring
   and gender composition of tutor-tutee pairs) affect various outcomes.
   Role theory is used as a theoretical framework to explain some
   intriguing and surprising findings (e.g., why tutors show academic gains
   even when they do not receive additional subject matter instruction, why
   longer and/or more substantial tutoring programs may not foster greater
   immediate academic gains than shorter programs, and why mixed-sex pairs
   do not consistently reap benefits equal to those of same-sex pairs).
   Finally, implications of the review for the development of peer and
   cross-age tutoring programs are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the cognitive capacities associated with the development of
   school readiness is indispensable to support children's successful
   school transition. It has been shown that executive function (EF) in
   preschoolers is associated with both concurrent preacademic and
   subsequent academic skills. However, most research has controlled for
   the effect of general cognitive ability (GCA), and little research has
   examined non-English speaking children, which hinders the understanding
   of the development of school readiness in culturally diverse contexts.
   In addition, behavioral genetic research on the genetic and
   environmental influences on this association has been conducted with
   school-age children. Thus, the genetic and environmental influences on
   associations between GCA, EF, and preacademic skills during preschool
   age are unknown. We conducted multivariate behavioral genetic analyses
   on two waves of longitudinal data at 42 and 60 months of age from 171
   and 135 pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic Japanese twins. The findings
   suggested that a genetic factor influenced GCA at 42 months and mediated
   preacademic ability at 60 months. In addition, another genetic factor
   emerged by 60 months that genetically mediated EF and math ability,
   independent of GCA. Preacademic ability at 60 months was affected by
   shared environments that influenced EF, rather than GCA, at 42 months.
   Moreover, shared environments that influenced preacademic ability at 42
   months affected later GCA at 60 months. Finally, nonshared environments
   that had emerged by 60 months mediated these relationships, though the
   magnitude of this effect was modest.}},

Abstract = {{Gendered stereotypes persist in American classrooms despite efforts to

   we examined both teachers' and administrators' perceptions of gender in

   administrators attributed conflict styles based upon gender and
   consistently reference boys conflict resolution style as over quickly in
   contrast to girls conflict resolution style. Likewise, participants'
   gendered perceptions extended to the kinds of feedback they expected
   girls and boys to prefer. Additionally, our findings show that
   participants misunderstood or lacked knowledge of scientifically sound
   research and participants described changing the curriculum in a
   single-sex class/school to use stereotypical topics and activities for

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the question of intergenerational schooling
   mobility in Senegal. We use an original survey conducted in 2003 that
   provides instruments to deal with the endogeneity of parent's education.
   In Senegal, school supply has been increasing a lot over the last
   decades, individuals who are now adults had different exposure to the
   schooling system, depending on where they lived when they were young and
   on their birth cohort. Hence, a first set of instruments describes the
   infrastructures available in the environment in which parents lived when
   they were 10 years old. Moreover, variation in education demand for a
   child is also driven by his/her position among his/her siblings, since
   older children tend to be less educated in West Africa. Being the first
   born is random but implies different educational outcomes than other
   birth ranks. Hence, the second set of instruments describes whether the
   parents were the first born among their same sex siblings. The estimated
   effect of father's education is more than double when its endogeneity is
   accounted for. Unexpectedly, mother's education comes out as a lesser
   determinant. We then focus on the understanding of the channels through
   which parental education affects children's schooling. We present the
   results pointing at the importance of the direct impact of parental
   education relative to the effect passing through wealth or household
   activity choices.}},

Abstract = {{Using a unique data set, collected from over 1000 A-level students, we
   obtain evidence of student interest and achievement in their chosen
   A-level subjects. Ten major A-level subjects are considered with
   particular attention focused on economics, a subject that has
   experienced a marked decline in popularity (by over 50\%) in the 1990s.
   A key finding is that students of economics under-perform in economics
   relative to both their other chosen A-levels and their GCSE performance.
   This finding is outstanding amongst the major A-levels. We conclude that
   students may be discouraged from the study of A-level economics by
   relatively severe grading at the mid-point of A-level study. Some
   positive action by the profession may be needed to stem fears of further
   decline in student take-up in the new AS-level environment where
   students may choose to discontinue some of their subjects at the end of

Abstract = {{The school formal in New Zealand constitutes a rich site of analysis for
   researchers interested in gender and sexuality performances. As a social
   space, the formal both shapes bodies and is shaped by them. In this
   article, we explore the school formals of three different types of
   schools: a single sex girls', a single sex boys' and a co-ed. high
   school, all from an urban centre. Using the theoretical tools provided
   by poststructuralism and queer theory, we conducted a discourse analysis
   of observations conducted by the first author at two school formals,
   interviews with staff and students and interviews with peer researchers.
   We demonstrate how same-sex practices do not necessarily map onto queer
   bodies, masculinity onto male' bodies or femininity onto female' bodies.
   Such fluidity challenges the rigid heterosexual/homosexual and
   masculine/feminine binaries so that schools are more inclusive of gender
   and sexual diversity. Complicar los espacios heteronormativos en las
   fiestas formales de graduacion escolar en Nueva ZelandaLa fiesta formal
   de graduacion en Nueva Zelanda constituye un sitio rico de analisis para
   lxs investigadorxs interesadxs en las performances de genero y
   sexualidad. Como espacio social, la fiesta formal tanto da forma a los
   cuerpos como es moldeada por ellos. En este articulo exploramos las
   fiestas formales de graduacion escolar de tres tipos de escuelas: una de
   ninas solamente, una de varones solamente y una secundaria mixta, todas
   en un centro urbano. Utilizando las herramientas teoricas que brindan el
   postestructuralismo y la teoria queer, realizamos un analisis de
   discurso de observaciones llevadas a cabo por la primera autora en dos
   fiestas de graduacion escolar, entrevistas con personal y estudiantes, y

Abstract = {{Two separate groups of dyslexia families were ascertained through
   probands attending special schools for dyslexic students. An additional
   control group of families was ascertained through randomly selected
   students attending public schools. The 3 groups were interviewed by
   questionnaire about the family's demographic characteristics, and about
   the incidence of reading and spelling disorders in all first and second
   order relatives. One group of dyslexia families was also examined by
   standardized intelligence and academic achievement tests. Developmental
   dyslexia was found to aggregate in families; there were 4-5 times as
   many affected males as females among clinically identified students
   attending the special schools, but the sex ratio of affected relatives
   after probands had been excluded was approximately 1.4 males for every
   female. Sibs were at greater risk for reading difficulties when one
   parent was affected than when neither parent was affected. Sibs were
   also at greater risk for academic difficulties, and affected sibs were
   more severely impaired, when the father rather than the mother was the
   affected parent. In dyslexia families with 2 affected parents, the sibs
   were at greater risk, and the affected sibs were more severely impaired,
   than in families where only one parent was affected. Moreover, in
   families with 2 affected parents, both of the parents were more severely
   impaired in reading and spelling than parents of the same sex in
   families with one affected parent. Some indirect evidence is presented
   that assortative mating may codetermine patterns of affectedness in
   dyslexia families. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   resulting in questionable validity of assessments. The author reviews
   these issues, proffers some explanations (e.g., gender schema theory),

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the reliability of the 5-min psychomotor vigilance
   task (PVT) in a single-sex Australian primary school. Seventy-five male
   students (mean age = 11.82 years, SD = 1.12) completed two 5-min PVTs
   using a Palm personal digital assistant (PDA) in (1) an isolated setting
   and (2) a classroom setting. Of this group of students, a subsample of
   37 students completed a test-retest reliability trial within the
   classroom setting. Using a mixed-model analysis, there was no
   significant difference in the mean response time (RT) or number of
   lapses (RTs > 500 msec) between the isolated and the classroom setting.
   There was, however, an order effect for the number of lapses in the
   isolated setting, with the number of lapses being greater if the
   isolated test was conducted second. Test-retest intraclass correlation
   coefficients (ICCs) in the classroom setting indicated moderate to high
   reliability (mean RT = .84, lapses = .59). Bland-Altman analysis showed
   no systematic difference between the two settings. Findings suggest that
   the 5-min PDA PVT is a reliable measure of sustained attention in the
   classroom setting in this sample of primary-aged schoolchildren. The
   results provide further evidence for the versatility of this measuring
   device for larger interventions outside the laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{Meta-analyses on the effect of peer tutoring have rarely examined the
   effect of peer tutoring on tutors' academic gain. Some previous analyses
   are dated and have methodological or theoretical limitations. Hence,
   there is a compelling need to fill this gap by conducting an updated and
   comprehensive meta-analysis for identifying certain determinants of best
   practices for peer tutoring on tutors' academic achievement in the
   present study. Additionally, role theory and equity theory in peer
   tutoring were tested. The present meta-analytic study examined 16
   articles using The comprehensive meta-analysis software programme and
   SPSS macro for analyses. It was found that the weighted mean effect size
   was 0.43 (p < 0.001). Moreover, the crucial parameters for optimizing
   the effectiveness of peer tutoring interventions are identified as
   follows: Tutees with low academic ability; tutors coming from secondary
   school; fewer tutor training sessions per week; shorter tutor training
   time per session; choosing mathematics as subject content; random
   assignment of tutees and tutors; structured peer tutoring; same-age
   non-reciprocal peer tutoring; same-sex dyad grouping; and more weekly
   tutoring sessions but longer tutoring time for each session.}},

Title = {{The hidden medical school: A longitudinal study of how social networks
   form, and how they relate to academic performance}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL TEACHER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{577-586}},
Abstract = {{Background: UK medical schools typically have over 300 students per
   year, making it impossible for students to know all the others well.
   Aims: This longitudinal cohort study measured the formation of medical
   student social networks and their relationship to grades.
   Method: In November 2009, 215/317 (68\%) Year 2 UCL medical students
   reported their friendships with others in their year, by questionnaire.
   Multiple regression assessed the relationship between friendships, exam
   results and background variables (obtained from student records), with
   permutation testing to assess statistical significance.
   Results: Students of the same sex, the same ethnic group, and in the
   same tutor and small groups (to which they were randomly assigned at the
   start of medical school) were socially closer. Taking into account
   absolute difference in Year 1 grades, Year 2 pairs who were socially
   closer in November 2009 had more similar May 2010 grades. Individual
   student variables did not predict similarity in 2010 grades after taking
   friendships into account.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that medical students chose friends of
   the same sex and ethnic group as themselves; but random allocation of
   students to tutor groups also influenced friendships. Most importantly,
   friendships related to subsequent exam performance, suggesting
   friendship may influence learning.}},

Abstract = {{Objective : To examine the association between weapon carrying on school
   property and engaging in health risk and problem behaviors such as
   fighting and substance use on school property, fear of attending school,
   and victimization at school.
   Design: A complex 2-stage probability survey (Massachusetts Youth Risk
   Behavior Survey).
   Setting: High schools in Massachusetts.
   Participants: Three thousand fifty-four high school students.
   Main Outcome Measure: Number of days a weapon was carried on school
   property during the 30 days prior to the survey.
   Results: The prevalence of self-reported weapon carrying on school
   property was 15\% among male students and 546 among female students
   (P<.001). Weapon carrying on school property was significantly (P<.001)
   associate with frequency of physical fights on school property (r=0.26),
   being a victim of threat or injury with a weapon on school property
   (r=0.27), being a victim of stolen or damaged goods on school property
   (r=0.14), not attending school owing to fear (r=0.15), and substance use
   while at school, including smoking cigarettes (r=0.20), using chewing
   tobacco (r=0.18), smoking marijuana (r=0.24), and using alcohol
   (r=0.29). The association between weapon carrying and alcohol use in
   school was higher amongs students who were afraid to come to school
   (r=0.49) than among students who were not afraid (r=0.28). Students who
   had engaged in same-sex sexual activity (P<.001) or had been offered,
   given, or sold illicit drugs at school (P<.001) were more likely to
   carry a weapon at school. Multiple regression analysis showed that male
   sex and the frequencies of physical fighting, being a victim of a threat
   or injury; drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, and being offered or
   sold an illicit drug while on school property accounted for 21\% of the
   variance in weapon carrying in school. When weapon carrying was
   dichotomized and analyzed with logistic regression, a model containing
   age, male sex, lower academic achievement,days nor attending school
   owing to fear, times threatened or injured with a weapon at school,
   frequency of fighting at school, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and
   being offered or sold illicit drugs on school property correctly
   classified 91.83\% of the students who did or did not carry weapons.
   Conclusions: Weapon carrying at school was more strongly associated more
   with use of violence and the use of substances at school than with
   previous victimization and fear of attending school. However, there is a
   subgroup of students that seems to have been victimization school, is
   afraid to come to school, is using alcohol at school, and is carrying
   weapons at school.}},

Abstract = {{This article is based upon a full-time study of masculinity and singing
   funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). Empirical
   work was conducted with boy performers and `peer audiences' for those
   performers in schools. The article focuses on girls' attitudes to boy
   singers and reveals a significant difference between primary and
   secondary schooling. In primary schools, girls are the more responsible
   for discouraging boys but in secondary schools the male peer group
   becomes more critical whilst girls increasingly perceive boy singers as
   `cute'. It is possible to construct a strong case for single-sex
   groupings but the empirical work suggests this may turn out to be
   misguided. The article concludes that there is an urgent need for girls
   and boys to learn mutual respect in the context of the music class. The
   evidence suggests that teachers require a significantly enhanced level
   of gender-related subject knowledge, gender awareness and interpersonal
   skill.}},

Title = {{Relational Teaching With Black Boys: Strategies for Learning at a
   Single-Sex Middle School for Boys of Color}},
Journal = {{TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background/Context: Positive teacher-student relationships are critical
   for Black boys' learning across single-sex and coeducational
   environments. Limited attention to these relationships by school
   professionals is rooted in deficit-oriented conceptions of boyhood and
   Black masculinity. The popular message of deficiency and pathology is
   clear: Black boys and men are either dangerous or at-risk and need to be
   saved. Such narrow conceptions are destructive, operate unconsciously,
   skew teachers' perceptions of who boys are, and distort teachers'
   efforts to meet boys' distinct learning needs. A ``boy crisis{''} in
   U.S. education has been characterized by a set of distressing school
   outcomes in specific learning categories. Racial marginalization and
   poverty only serve to exacerbate these negative academic outcomes,
   whereby low-income Black boys remain in the bottom quartile across all
   achievement measures. Scholars have recently begun to partly attribute
   boys' underachievement to a lack of emphasis on the relational dimension
   of schools.
   Purpose/Focus of the Study: (1) Illustrate how a set of relational
   teaching strategies supported Black boys' engagement and learning, and
   (2) further contribute boys' ``voice{''} to a counternarrative, which
   strives to complicate and dispel negative race and gender stereotypes
   associated with Black males in the United States.
   Setting/Population/Participants: This study employs a relational
   teaching framework to examine the learning relationships among teachers
   and a full cohort of eighth-grade Black boys (N = 27) at a single-sex
   middle school for boys of color in New York City.
   Research Design/Data Collection: In-depth interviews from a critical
   ethnography conducted at the school-site (2011-2012) culled boys'
   narratives of their teacher-student relationships.
   Findings/Discussion: Boys particularly expressed how teachers must
   foremost convey mastery of course content, with a lucid set of humane
   behavioral expectations. Narratives from the boys revealed how
   relationally effective teachers consistently enacted the following
   gestures: reaching out and go beyond; personal advocacy; establishing
   common ground; and accommodating opposition. Teachers demonstrated the
   capacity to acquire and refine relational gestures, but relationship
   struggles among the boys and their teachers were commonplace. Core
   findings include: (a) Boys illuminated how specific aspects of the
   school context facilitated successful enactment of the relational
   teaching strategies by teachers; (b) teachers' use of the relational
   strategies was also facilitated by the social categories of race,
   gender, and class the boys embodied; (c) boys' engagement and learning
   benefitted from positive teacher-student relationships, which ensued
   after effective use of the relational teaching strategies; and (d)
   relational teaching with Black boys is not limited to either single-sex
   or coeducational learning environments.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the association between socioemotional dispositions
   from the developmental propensity model and reading comprehension and
   whether those associations could be accounted for by level of chaos in
   the home. Data from 342 monozygotic and 333 same-sex dizygotic twin
   pairs age 7-13 years were used. A parent rated the twins on sympathy,
   respect for rules, negative emotionality, and daring and level of chaos
   in the twins' home. Reading comprehension was measured using a
   state-wide school assessment. Only respect for rules significantly and
   uniquely predicted reading comprehension. Biometric models indicated
   that respect for rules was positively associated with reading
   comprehension via the shared environment and home chaos accounted for a
   significant amount of that shared environmental variance even after
   controlling for family income. Children with higher respect for rules
   have better reading comprehension scores in school and this relationship
   owes partly to the level of chaos in the family home. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{The moment a child walks into a new classroom, teachers and classmates
   form an impression based on minimal information. Yet, little is known
   about the accuracy of such impressions when it concerns children's
   social functioning at school. The current study examined the accuracy of

   children based on thin slices of behavior. The likeability, popularity,
   prosocial behavior, aggression, and exclusion of these children were
   judged by 101 children, 79 elementary school teachers, and 68 young
   adults based on 20-second video clips. Judges were better than chance in
   predicting popularity and prosocial behavior, but worse than chance in
   predicting aggression and exclusion. Female judges were more accurate
   judging social exclusion of same-sex than other-sex targets. Teachers
   were more accurate than children in their judgments of prosocial

Abstract = {{Increasing the number of Black men teachers and single-sex schooling
   options have been heralded as necessary to reverse trends in the failure
   of US education institutions to adequately educate Black boys. Too
   little research interrogates Black men teachers' interactions with Black
   boys for how they might reinforce anti-oppressive conceptions of race,
   gender and sexuality. A genre study - the multidimensional,
   intersectional examination of social identity to explain one's
   persistent dehumanization - was utilized to investigate how Black men
   teachers' interactions with Black boys shape the boys' understanding of
   Black manhood and masculinities. Regardless of schooling arrangement,
   findings suggest Black men teachers must recognize and disavow hegemonic
   gender logics in interaction efforts aimed at improving Black boys'
   lives. Additionally, I argue the potential of Black men teachers'
   interactions with Black boys to function as sites for reimagining Black
   boys' humanity in ways that counter persistent messages of their
   inferiority and disposability (i.e. aniblackness).}},

   interaction between teachers and students in a computer-supported
   learning environment. However, empirical research about learning paths
   is scarce. Previous studies showed that the low adoption of learning
   paths can be linked to the lack of knowledge on the part of teachers
   about learning path design and its implementation. In the present study,
   which was undertaken in the context of a biology course in secondary
   education, 496 14- to 15-years old secondary school students in Flanders
   were assigned to either learning path based or conventional instruction
   during classroom activities. The aim was to analyze the differential
   impact of the instructional formats on learning outcomes, considering
   variations in group setting and group composition. Given the focus on
   science learning, gender was also considered. Multilevel analysis was
   applied, and the results show empirical evidence for superior
   performance for both boys and girls in the learning path condition as
   compared with that in the conventional condition. In addition, when
   girls collaborate, they perform best within same-sex groups, whereas
   boys achieve better results in mixed-gender groups. The implications of
   the findings are important for tackling the gender gap in science
   learning. The findings can lead to guidelines for teachers who want to
   implement learning paths within an optimal learning environment design.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the social consequences of neighborhood
   violence. Using ego-centered friendship network data from the National
   Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a survey of adolescents in the
   United States in the mid-1990s, it examines the relationship between
   neighborhood violence and the quantity, closeness, and composition of
   adolescent same-sex friendships. Though neighborhood violence is
   unrelated to quantity and closeness net of individual and family
   characteristics, it predicts boys' friendships with individuals who no
   longer attend school ( who are presumably older or have dropped out of
   school) and predicts boys' and girls' friendships with individuals who
   attend other schools. These results are consistent with the theory that
   violence and fear of victimization focus adolescents' social attention
   on their neighborhoods and lead them to develop friendships with
   individuals who can help them to stay safe. By structuring who
   adolescents interact with, neighborhood violence may play a role in
   determining the cultural messages and ideals to which they are exposed.}},

Abstract = {{This study compared the effects of reviewing strategies in shared

   and note reading, on elementary school student note-taking quality and
   achievement. A non-equivalent pre- and post-test design was adopted. The
   participants were 188 sixth grade Taiwanese students in six computing
   classes. Through random assignment, two classes were assigned to the
   shared note-taking with questioning condition (SN-SQ), two classes to
   the shared note-taking with summarizing condition (SN-SS), and two
   classes to the shared note-taking with note reading condition (SN-SR).
   Students in each condition were arranged into same-sex dyads. The
   members of a dyad were assigned to separate computers, seated
   side-by-side, and required to collaborate with one another on a shared
   note-taking with reviewing task. The results revealed that the SN-SS
   students' notes contained more facts and concepts than the SN-SR

Abstract = {{We document and analyze the emergence of a substantial gender gap in
   mathematics in the early years of schooling using a large, recent, and
   nationally representative panel of US children. There are no mean
   differences between boys and girls upon entry to school, but girls lose
   more than two-tenths of a standard deviation relative to boys over the
   first six years of school. The ground lost by girls relative to boys is
   roughly half as large as the black-white test score gap that appears
   over these same ages. We document the presence of this gender math gap
   across every strata of society. We explore a wide range of possible
   explanations in the data, including less investment by girls in math,
   low parental expectations, and biased tests, but find little support for
   these theories. Moving to cross-country comparisons, we find earlier
   results linking the gender gap in math to measures of gender equality
   are sensitive to the inclusion of Muslim countries, where, in spite of
   women's low status, there is little or no gender gap in math. (JEL I23,

Journal = {{TEACHING EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{357-373}},
Abstract = {{Recent debates regarding same-sex marriage and gay and lesbian adoption
   highlight the role of schools as sociopolitical institutions.
   Accordingly, teachers operating within social norms have considerable
   influence through their interactions with students and their families.
   Previous research points to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
   (LGBT) parents' frustrations with their children's schools, particularly
   as teachers resist representing LGBT families within curricula and fail
   to intervene when homophobic comments are made. Yet teachers' capacity
   to embrace diverse family structures while adhering to cultural
   expectations for teachers remains unexplored. This study, rooted in
   queer theory, explores the social norms teachers name for parenting in
   school settings and the way teachers position LGBT parents within these
   norms. Findings point to social norms for teachers and parents which
   indicate that teachers operate within heteronormative frameworks. They
   consider heterosexuality to be normal, while positioning LGBT identities
   as deviant. This is troubling given documented connections between
   teacher attitudes and parental involvement and between parental
   involvement and student achievement. Unchecked, heteronormative
   practices may result in inequitable school experiences for LGBT parents
   and their children. Teacher education must minimize heteronormativity
   through equipping teachers to attend to their own notions and
   assumptions regarding the intersection of parenting and sexual
   orientation.}},

Pages = {{797-819}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides estimates of the causal effect of living in an
   overcrowded home on performance at school in France. Our identification
   strategy relies on the fact that the size and housing conditions of
   families vary with the sex composition of the siblings. In particular,
   large families in which the two youngest children are (by descending
   age) a boy and a girl tend to live less often in overcrowded housing
   than the other families. French parents seem to be more reluctant about
   bringing up their children in the same room when they are not of the
   same sex, especially when the youngest one is a girl. We build on these
   results to develop several econometric analyses of the effect of
   overcrowding on schooling outcomes using variables describing the sex
   composition of the siblings as instrumental variables. These different
   strategies reveal that the very strong statistical relationship between
   housing conditions and academic failure is plausibly one of cause and
   effect. Children in large families perform much less well than children
   in small families, but our IV estimates suggest that this is mostly due
   to the fact that they live in more overcrowded homes. (c) 2004 Elsevier

   Students spent 14 to 30 (M = 22.7) hours in a programming class. At the
   beginning and the end of the project, each participant separately
   completed (a) computer programming knowledge assessments and (b)
   questionnaires rating their affinity for their partner. Results support
   the proposition that liking promotes learning: Greater partner affinity
   predicted greater subsequent increases in computer programming knowledge
   for both partners. One partner's initial programming knowledge also
   positively predicted the other partner's subsequent partner affinity.

Abstract = {{Gender inequalities in schools have implications for life chances,
   emotional well-being and educational policies and practices, but are
   apparently resistant to change. This paper employs Judith Butler's
   conceptualisation of performativity in a study of young people and
   consumption to provide insights into gendered inequities. It argues that
   how the young people `do' gender in focus groups frequently involves the
   discussion of young women's bodies and clothes in ways that are
   `culturally intelligible'. The focus on young women's bodies produced
   joking relationships and a taken- for- granted understanding of gender
   in some same-sex interactions, but sometimes created tension and
   divisions in mixedgender groups. Discussions of sexualisation in
   single-sex and mixed-sex groups were similarly emotionally loaded. The
   paper argues that attention to gender inequalities requires detailed
   attention to the differential power relations in which boys express
   desires to control feminine bodies and girls police their own and other
   girls' bodies. Methodologically, the paper suggests that focus group
   discussions constitute an ethnographic site for analysis and that
   researchers coconstruct young people's narratives of embodied gender
   practices in ways that mediate young people's gendered performances.}},

Title = {{Multivariate behavioral genetic analysis of achievement and cognitive

Journal = {{HUMAN BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{70}},

Abstract = {{In recent years behavioral genetic studies have provided conclusive
   evidence that reading disability and related learning disorders, such as
   mathematics disability, are due at least in part to heritable factors
   (DeFries et al. 1987; Alarcon et al. 1997). Although the observed
   relationship between performance in these areas also may be due
   substantially to genetic influences (Light and DeFries 1995; Thompson et
   al, 1991) relatively few studies have examined the genetic and
   environmental etiology of this covariation in a multivariate framework.
   In the present study data from 196 identical (monozygotic; MZ) and 155
   same-sex fraternal (dizygotic; DZ) twin pairs in which at least one
   member of each pair evidenced reading problems in school (reading
   disabled) were subjected to a multivariate behavioral genetic analysis.
   Structural equation models were fitted to twin data for verbal IQ (VIQ),
   phonological decoding ability (PHON), reading performance (READ), and
   mathematics performance (MATH) to assess the extent to which VIQ and
   PHON mediate the observed covariation between READ and MATH. Results
   suggest that VIQ and PHON account for most of the covariation between
   READ and MATH, Moreover, approximately 82\% of the observed correlation
   between READ and MATH was due to genetic factors that also influence VIQ
   and PHON. When data from 132 MZ and 91 same-sex DZ control twin pairs in
   which neither twin had a history of reading problems were subjected to
   the same analyses, the covariation between READ and MATH was found to be
   due to both genetic and shared environmental influences, Thus genetic
   factors that influence VIQ and PHON also contribute to the observed
   covariation between READ and MATH in both a reading-disabled and a
   control twin sample.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines predictors of observer accuracy (i.e. seeing) and
   target accuracy (i.e. being seen) in perceptions of classmates'
   relationships in a predominantly African American sample of 420 second
   through fourth graders (ages 7-11). Girls, children in higher grades,
   and children in smaller classrooms were more accurate observers. Targets
   (i.e. pairs of children) were more accurately observed when they
   occurred in smaller classrooms of higher grades and involved same-sex,
   high-popularity, and similar-popularity children. Moreover,
   relationships between pairs of girls were more accurately observed than
   relationships between pairs of boys. As a set, these findings suggest
   the importance of both observer and target characteristics for
   children's accurate perceptions of classroom relationships. Moreover,
   the substantial variation in observer accuracy and target accuracy has
   methodological implications for both peer-reported assessments of
   classroom relationships and the use of stochastic actor-based models to
   understand peer selection and socialization processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{84-92}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare the risk status on health and behavior for those
   with same-sex partners and those without.
   Methods: Add Health data provide a sample of 20,745 adolescents in
   grades 7 through 12 interviewed at home. The risk statuses of
   respondents with no partners, same-sex-only partners, and partners of
   both sexes were compared to respondents with opposite-sex partners only.
   Respondents were evaluated on selected personal and social attributes
   (verbal IQ, family structure, masculinity, popularity), and risk status
   (substance use, depression, suicidal thoughts, anal sex, general
   delinquency, being physically attacked, perceived risk of being killed
   or getting AIDS). Data were analyzed by logistic and linear regression
   using STATA to adjust for clustering and sampling weights.
   Results: Compared to boys with opposite-sex-only partners, boys with
   same-sex-only partners were at high risk for emotional problems, but not
   delinquency or substance use. Boys with partners of both sexes were at
   high risk for delinquency and substance use, but not for emotional
   problems. Neither group of boys with same-sex partners is at high risk
   of being attacked compared to those with opposite-sex partners only.
   Girls with only same-sex partners are never a high-risk group, while
   girls with partners of both sexes are the high-risk category in every
   case.
   Conclusions: Adolescents with same-sex-only partners do not resemble
   those with partners of both sexes in risk status. Combining the two
   categories obscures the unique risk profile of those with both-sex
   partners, and obscures the low risk on most variables but the high
   emotional risk of boys with only same-sex partners. Society for

Pages = {{75-91}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the interaction
   effect between grade level and gender with respect to students'
   attitudes toward chemistry lessons taught in secondary schools. The
   sample consisted of 954 chemistry students in grades Secondary 4-7
   (approximately 16-19 years of age) in Hong Kong. Students' attitudes
   were surveyed using an attitude toward chemistry lessons scale (ATCLS),
   and subscale scores were produced on four dimensions: liking for
   chemistry theory lessons; liking for chemistry laboratory work;
   evaluative beliefs about school chemistry; and behavioral tendencies to
   learn chemistry. When the ATCLS data were subjected to two-way MANOVA,
   the interaction effect between grade level and gender on students'
   attitudes toward chemistry lessons was statistically significant. The
   interaction effect was attributable to scores on the theory lessons
   subscale and laboratory work subscale. Male students in Secondary 4 and
   5 liked chemistry theory lessons more than their female counterparts.
   However, male students' liking for chemistry laboratory work declined
   when they progressed from Secondary 4 to Secondary 7; no such a
   significant decline in attitude toward chemistry laboratory work was
   found in females. Overall, both males and females were just marginally
   positive about chemistry lessons during the years of secondary
   schooling. Implications of these findings for curriculum design are
   discussed.}},

Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{57-72}},

Abstract = {{Schools are quasi-public/private organisations and being a teacher
   involves negotiating personal and professional boundaries. These
   boundaries have posed particular challenges for lesbian, gay, bisexual,
   transgender and queer (LGBT-Q) teachers whose everyday lives are
   complicated by legislative, religious and cultural constraints, moral
   panics about childhood innocence, reductive discourses about sexuality
   and negative stereotypes. In many contexts, the past decade has seen
   rapid change in the politics of sexuality as legal structures for
   same-sex relationships have emerged and promised normalisation for
   LGBT-Q people. Such developments raise questions about how these
   changing politics of sexuality are spilling over into school contexts.
   In Ireland, entering into a civil partnership (CP) altered the shape of
   LGB teachers' relations with their colleagues in schools. But neoliberal
   systems of performance and accountability coalesce with a persisting
   uncomfortable relationship between LGBT-Q identification and schooling
   ensuring that LGBT-Q teachers have different kinds of relations with
   parents and students. This paper provides new insight into these
   relations as LGB teachers entered into a CP. I argue that their work to
   manage these relations had ambivalent effects. Fore-fronting a
   high-performing professional subjectivity and maintaining distances with
   students while acting as agents of change (re)produced heteronormativity
   but simultaneously enabled moments that promised queer, transgressive
   potential.}},

   We describe and critically assess four theoretical approaches to
   examining family forms-family structure, evolutionary, characteristics,
   and context-and their implications for children, and we discuss the
   utility of an approach that views family characteristics in social
   context. We also recommend that instead of using alternative family
   forms primarily or solely as counterfactuals to the so-called
   traditional family, researchers should compare alternative family forms
   to each other, noting theoretical implications for commonalities and
   differences found among these groups. We call for additional research on
   alternative families, noting its importance for sociology, family

Abstract = {{The project addresses pressing concerns about children's participation
   in learning. In the M-ASK model, the effects of self concepts on
   participation are mediated by task values. The aim was to show where
   common and variant models apply across personal and social contexts.
   Study 1 examined M-ASK models in the context of content (literacy,
   numeracy) over time in a rural location, and Study 2 examined content,
   gender, and school type in an urban location. Participants in Study 1
   were 11- to 12-year-old children (N = 102, girls 56\%, boys 44\%) in a
   rural location. Participants in Study 2 were 11 to 16 years old (N =
   930) at co-ed (girls 18\%, boys 21\%) and single-sex schools (girls
   29\%, boys 32\%) in an urban location. Study 1 supported M-ASK models
   for literacy and numeracy at Time 1 and 2. In Study 2, M-ASK models were
   common for literacy and numeracy by girls and boys in co-ed and
   single-sex schools. Direct links from self concepts to participation
   were particular only to traditional stereotypical contexts (literacy for
   girls and numeracy for boys, in co-ed schools). The M-ASK model of
   participation in learning activities generally holds across content and
   gender, in rural and urban locations, over time. The applications are
   vital for the design of common and differentiated motivational
   programmes to engage children in learning.}},

Abstract = {{This study outlines a method used to evaluate sex education. Results
   from a questionnaire are presented from 3314 Year 11 students in 25
   schools from non-metropolitan Britain. Over 70\% answered that their sex

   intercourse, contraception and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs);
   51\% demonstration of condoms; 45\% personal morality; and 36\%
   assertiveness training including `how to say no', Teenagers' assessment
   of sex education was varied but only the minority (44\%) considered it
   satisfactory, Over 70\% said they thought teaching a wide range of
   topics should start in Year 8 (aged 11/12 years), most (75\%) wanted
   outside agencies involved in the teaching, (57\%) did not want parents
   to provide `most of it' and (70\%) did not want it taught in single-sex
   groups, School was the most frequently specified source of `most
   helpful' information on contraception (38\%) and STDs (45\%), Teenagers
   within schools perceived to deliver above average input on contraception
   and STDs were more likely to cite school as their most helpful source of
   information, Increasing input was not associated with increasing
   awareness of risks from STDs nor improved knowledge of contraception,
   The questionnaire and reporting of comparative findings back to the
   schools will allow an assessment of current practice and future change
   to sex education programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Subjective assesssment by parents and objective findings in children
   previously at risk perinatally. Several studies have shown no
   correlation between individual perinatal risk factors and outcome.
   Rather, the children's development depends more on social factors. In
   our retrospective study we compared the development of 26 at-risk
   newborns with that of a same-sex healthy sibling 10 to 16 years later.
   Data were collected by interview, questionnaires and neuropsychological
   tests.
   In the parents' view, the children who were at-risk newborns had a
   special position in the family (close mother-child relationship,
   overprotectiveness, child cause for concern). They had more educational
   and behavioral problems and their social network was limited. With one
   exception (d2 test), the neuropsychological tests showed no significant
   differences between the two groups of children. However, overall the
   at-risk children had more attention deficit disorders with hyperactivity
   (ICD-10, F90.0) and more selected learning disturbances (F81). A
   division of the children into those with minor and major perinatal risk
   factors was not of predictive value for outcome. There was only a low
   correlation between the parent's assessments of the at-risk children and
   more objective criteria (need for professional help or special
   schooling). The authors discuss the types of support that should be
   provided to parents with at-risk newborns.}},

Title = {{The impact of a peer counselling scheme to address bullying in an
   all-girl London secondary school: A short-term longitudinal study}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{69-86}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background. A variety of peer support schemes are now widely used in
   schools, notably to reduce bullying. However, there has been little
   systematic investigation of the impact and effectiveness of these
   approaches.
   Aims. To assess the impact of a peer counselling scheme on peer
   counsellors and the school community.
   Sample. The research was conducted in a North London all-girls state
   secondary school. Data were collected from all lower school classes
   (years 7, 8, and 9) and some staff members, in addition to year 10 peer
   counsellors and an age equivalent comparison group.
   Methods. A detailed 1-year longitudinal study combined qualitative and
   quantitative methods of assessment.
   Results. Peer counsellors benefited from their involvement through an
   acquisition of transferable communication and interpersonal skills, and,
   compared to age-matched control pupils, had increased social
   self-esteem. There were no reductions in self-reported bullying and
   victimization, but in general pupils believed that there was less
   bullying in school and that the school was doing more about bullying,
   with year 7 students showing the most positive changes.
   Conclusions. Peer-counselling schemes can improve self-esteem of peer
   supporters, and also impact positively on perceptions of bullying in the
   school; but impact on actual experiences of bullying is less clear, and
   there may be problems with the acceptance and use of such programmes by
   older students.}},

Abstract = {{This cohort study examines whether a mental disorder diagnosis, the type
   of disorder, and other variables play a role in the decision to take the
   ninth-grade final examination and in the examination outcome among young
   people in Denmark.
   Key PointsQuestionWhat are the educational achievements at the final
   examination of compulsory schooling in Denmark among individuals with or
   without a mental disorder? FindingsIn this nationwide cohort study of
   629622 individuals, 52\% of those with a mental disorder took the final
   examination compared with 88\% of those without a mental disorder.
   Students with a mental disorder who took the examination attained
   considerably lower grades on the examination. MeaningThe findings of
   this study suggest that a mental disorder in childhood or adolescence is
   associated with lower educational achievements and that additional
   educational support for these individuals may be needed.
   ImportanceOnset of mental disorders during childhood or adolescence has
   been associated with underperformance in school and impairment in social
   and occupational life in adulthood, which has important implications for
   the affected individuals and society. ObjectiveTo compare the
   educational achievements at the final examination of compulsory
   schooling in Denmark between individuals with and those without a mental
   disorder. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis population-based cohort
   study was conducted in Denmark and obtained data from the Danish Civil
   Registration System and other nationwide registers. The 2 cohorts
   studied were (1) all children who were born in Denmark between January
   1, 1988, and July 1, 1999, and were alive at age 17 years (n=629622) and
   (2) all children who took the final examination at the end of ninth
   grade in both Danish and mathematics subjects between January 1, 2002,
   and December 31, 2016 (n=542 500). Data analysis was conducted from
   March 1, 2018, to March 1, 2019. ExposuresClinical diagnosis by a
   psychiatrist of any mental disorder or 1 of 29 specific mental disorders
   before age 16 years. Main Outcomes and MeasuresTaking the final
   examination at the end of ninth grade and mean examination grades
   standardized as z scores with differences measured in SDs (standardized
   mean grade difference). ResultsOf the total study population (n=629622;
   306209 female and 323413 male), 523312 individuals (83\%) took the final
   examination before 17 years of age and 38001 (6\%) had a mental disorder
   before that age. Among the 542500 individuals (274332 female and 268168
   male), the mean (SD) age was 16.1 (0.33) years for the females and 16.2
   (0.34) years for the males. Among the 15843 female and 22158 male
   students with a mental disorder, a lower proportion took the final
   examination (0.52; 95\% CI, 0.52-0.53) compared with individuals without
   a mental disorder (0.88; 95\% CI, 0.88-0.88). Mental disorders affected
   the grades of male individuals (standardized mean grade difference,
   -0.30; 95\% CI, -0.32 to -0.28) more than the grades of their female
   peers (standardized mean grade difference, -0.24; 95\% CI, -0.25 to
   -0.22) when compared with same-sex individuals without mental disorders.
   Most specific mental disorders were associated with statistically
   significantly lower mean grades, with intellectual disability associated
   with the lowest grade in female and male students (standardized mean
   grade difference, -1.07 {[}95\% CI, -1.23 to -0.91] and -1.03 {[}95\%
   CI, -1.17 to -0.89]; P=.76 for sex differences in the mean grades).
   Female and male students with anorexia nervosa achieved statistically
   significantly higher grades on the final examination (standardized mean
   grade difference, 0.38 {[}95\% CI, 0.32-0.44] and 0.31 {[}95\% CI,
   0.11-0.52]; P=.54 for sex differences in the mean grades) compared with
   their peers without this disorder. For those with anxiety, attachment,
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity, and other developmental disorders,
   female individuals attained relatively lower standardized mean grades
   compared with their male counterparts. Conclusions and RelevanceResults
   of this study suggest that, in Denmark, almost all mental disorders in
   childhood or adolescence may be associated with a lower likelihood of
   taking the final examination at the end of ninth grade; those with
   specific disorders tended to achieve lower mean grades on the
   examination; and female, compared with male, individuals with certain
   mental disorders appeared to have relatively more impairment.
   These findings appear to emphasize the need to provide educational
   support to young people with mental disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Computer instructional programs designed to achieve equitable
   educational outcomes for girls have yielded mixed results. The present
   intervention involved 59 preschool boys and girls. Within three
   classrooms, separate girls' and boys' microcomputer groups were formed
   and matched respectively with girls' and boys' control groups (nature
   groups). The microcomputer groups received training in open-ended
   software and were taught basic skills in the LOGO language, over a
   six-week period.  The control groups participated for the same amount of
   time in a variety of moderately novel, nature-related activities that
   were designed as gender-neutral. Both groups had female instructors and
   same-sex pairing.  There were two major findings. The first result was
   that the girls' microcomputer group did not show more positive
   gender-role attitudes toward computers on the prottest when compared
   with the girls' control group. Both groups of girls viewed computers as
   more appropriate for their own gender than on the pretest. The second
   result was that in spite of equivalent instruction designed to hold the
   interest of girls, boys completed a significantly greater number of LOGO
   tasks than girls after the intervention.  The question of possible
   initial advantages of the boys is discussed. Educational interventions
   with equitable goals face great difficulties in achieving and
   demonstrating effectiveness.  This study suggests that measures of
   performance should be included in such demonstrations.}},

Abstract = {{Relatively little is known about bullying and defending behaviors of
   children in early elementary school. However, this period is crucial for
   children's development as at this age they start to participate in a
   stable peer group, and difficulties in social interactions can be
   detected early by professionals. An interactive animated web-based
   computer program was used in this study to assess peer relationships
   among young children. The computerized assessment was conducted among
   2,135 children in grades 1-2 from 22 elementary schools to examine the
   association of bullying, victimization, and defending with being
   accepted or rejected. Same-sex and other-sex peer relations were
   distinguished using dyadic data. Both boys and girls were more likely to
   accept same-sex classmates than other-sex classmates, and boys were more
   often nominated than girls as perpetrators of bullying against both boys
   and girls. It was found that bullies were rejected by those for whom
   they posed a potential threat, and that defenders were preferred by
   those classmates for whom they were a potential source of protection.
   Bullies chose victims who were rejected by significant others, but
   contrary to expectations, children who bullied boys scored low on peer
   affection. It is possible that these bullies were not strategic enough
   to select the right targets. Overall, the current findings provide
   evidence for strategies involved in bullying and defending at early age.

Abstract = {{The following study examined narrative skills in 89 poverty children,
   half of whom had received an infant daycare intervention (experimental)
   and half whom had not (control). At school entry these groups were split
   again with half of each group receiving school-age intervention. For
   each child in the sample, a child of the same sex in their classroom was
   chosen to form a local population sample (LPS). Children were read
   stories of varying thematic cohesiveness and asked both to comprehend
   and paraphrase the narratives in the fall and spring of the kindergarten
   year. The results indicated that the preschool experimental group
   performed better than the preschool control group on the comprehension
   and paraphrase of the stories in the fall but not in the spring. The LPS
   group was especially better able to paraphrase stories in comparison to
   the poverty groups. Discussion is centred on reasons for the convergence
   of the two poverty groups over kindergarten and the possible cultural
   differences that led to their poorer performance with respect to the LPS
   group.}},

Abstract = {{Self-rating of pubertal development is the recommended method to assess
   puberty in large community-based surveys of adolescent development and
   behavior. The aim of this study was to validate for the first time
   pubertal self-assessment using the sexual maturation scale developed by
   Tanner among Black South African adolescents (n=182) aged between 10 and
   18 years who were recruited and assessed at public schools in
   Soweto-Johannesburg. There was significant concordance between
   adolescents' and same sex health professional's assessment of pubic hair
   growth and breast development in females (kappa coefficients .71 and
   .76, respectively; p <.0005), and pubic hair growth and genital
   development in males (kappa coefficients .63 and .60, respectively; p
   <.0005). We conclude that the Tanner pubertal self-rating appears to be
   a reasonably valid instrument to use among black South African youth.
   The tool can be administered in school or other community-based settings
   with moderate confidence provided the procedure is thoroughly explained
   to the participant through the developed tutorial in the language of

Abstract = {{Using a representative national sample (N = 20,745), this article
   explores health and mental health needs, service use, and barriers to
   services among sexual minority youths (SMYs) and heterosexual peers.
   SMYs were defined by ever having a same-sex romantic attraction or
   having a recent same-sex romantic relationship or sexual partner. SMYs
   accounted for 7.5 percent of the sample. Data were analyzed to ascertain
   prevalence of risks and explore group differences. Compared with peers,
   SMY self-reports indicated higher prevalence rates on all indicators of
   health and mental health need. SMYs reported more sexual activity, more
   sexually transmitted disease diagnoses, a higher perceived risk for
   HIV/AIDS, and more forgone medical care than peers. Also compared with
   peers, SMYs reported higher levels of anxiety, depression, suicidality,
   and physical and sexual victimization and higher rates of unmet mental
   health need. SMYs also reported greater concerns about confidentiality
   and were less likely to use school-based services. The majority of SMYs
   reported same-sex attraction only. Social work and other helping
   professionals should incorporate same-sex attraction questions into
   assessment protocols to target services for this population. School- and
   office-based providers must consider whether their services are
   welcoming and offer sufficient assurances of confidentiality to
   facilitate access by SMYs.}},

   data from twin pairs tested in the Colorado Learning Disabilities
   Research Center were fitted to structural equation models of sex

   correlation between performance in males and females were obtained by
   analysis of data from both same-sex and opposite-sex twin pairs (Neale

Abstract = {{School settings are volatile and often violent for LGBT teens who are

   LGBT students in Thai secondary schools towards homosexuality. Students
   aged 12-19 years were surveyed in 393 public institutions providing
   secondary-school education in six regions of Thailand, selected by a
   multistage cluster sampling. Among 1088 LGBT-identified students, 378
   (35\%) reported negative attitudes toward homosexuality. Factors
   associated with homonegative attitudes in a multivariable logistic
   regression analysis were identifying as a transgender (Adjusted Odds
   Ratio {[}aOR] 2.5, 95\% CI 1.5-4.1), having low academic performance
   (GPA scores of 2-3 {[}aOR 2.6, 95\% CI 1.7-4.1] or less than 2 {[}aOR

   covering topics such as bullying LGBT students (aOR 1.9, 95\% CI
   1.2-3.1) and safe homosexual practices (aOR 2.1, 95\% CI 1.7-4.1).
   Sexuality education in its current form in Thai public schools may not
   be effective in reducing homonegative attitudes of LGBT-identified
   students. A more comprehensive sexuality education emphasising gender
   and rights along with strategies addressing social disparities due to
   sexual orientation is needed to enable Thai LGBT teens to accept their
   sexuality without shame and self-disrespect.}},

Abstract = {{Low female participation rates in computing are a current concern of the
   education sector. To address this problem an intervention was developed
   - computing skills were introduced to girls in their English classes
   using three different teaching styles: peer tutoring, cross-age tutoring
   and teacher instruction (control). The sample comprised 136 girls from
   Years 8 and 10 from a single-sex government school. A pre-test post-test
   quantitative design was used. To describe the students perspectives,
   qualitative data were collected from six focus groups conducted with
   8-10 students - one from each of the six classes. It was predicted that
   cross-age tutoring would yield more positive effects than peer tutoring
   which, in turn, would yield more positive effects than traditional
   teacher instruction as assessed by achievement on class tasks and
   attitudes towards computing. The hypothesis was not supported by the
   quantitative analysis, however in the qualitative data cross-age
   tutoring was appraised more favourably than peer tutoring or teacher
   instruction. The latter was the least preferred condition due to: (1)
   inefficiency; (2) difficulty understanding teachers' explanations; and
   (3) lack of teacher knowledge. Problems with the implementation of the
   intervention identified in the focus groups were teacher differences,
   system failures, missed classes, lack of communication, and selection of
   computing activities. Practical suggestions were provided relevant to
   the introduction of cross-age tutoring and the use of computers within
   secondary level English classes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A number of studies report that from the first years of life, preterm
   children have more difficulty self-regulating and communicating in their
   social group. If these children show signs of difficulty adjusting
   socially, the question then is whether or not these problems continue
   and persist over time. The objective is to observe the combined effects
   of birth status and the passage of time on the resolution/persistence of
   the social problems. At age 7, the social adjustment of 96 extremely
   preterm (EP) children was assessed in a school setting, and 82 (85\%)
   were followed at 11 years, and matched with three healthy term peers of
   the same sex and socioeconomic status (SES) recruited in the same
   classroom. A total of 375 children have been casted by their classmates
   in social roles through a sociometric interview at 7 and 11 years. The
   findings indicate a customary stability in term children but persistent
   or even increasing problems of victimization in EP children and a
   decrease of aggressiveness over time in the EP boys subgroup. Moreover,
   we found persistent social isolation problems in the subgroup of EP
   girls at 7 and 11 years. It can be concluded that prematurity is
   associated with a process of social marginalization that results from
   both the children's very limitations and the resultant reputation
   effects. At these ages, any discrepancy is quickly judged as a weakness
   that children do not want to be associated with. Furthermore, the
   passage of time confirms this and reinforces the marginalization
   process.}},

Abstract = {{The role of framed eyeglasses in children's person schemata was
   examined. American first graders (35 girls, 36 boys), rated by their
   teachers as low, medium, or high in cognitive development, judged peers
   photographed with and without glasses for physical attractiveness,
   school performance, conduct, sociability, and sociometric choice. There
   was a general same-sex bias in the children's ratings. The stimulus
   persons tended to be rated lower in attractiveness (especially if they
   were girls), school performance, and conduct when they were wearing
   glasses than when they were not wearing glasses. Glasses negatively
   influenced sociometric choice, but only for the most cognitively
   developed children. These results indicated that adults' stereotypes
   about people who wear glasses eventually become part of children's
   person schemata.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. We examined associations between adolescents' safety belt
   use and sexual orientation identity.
   Methods. We pooled data from the 2005 and 2007 Youth Risk Behavior
   Surveys (n = 26 468 weighted; mean age = 15.9 years; 35.4\% White,
   24.7\% Black, 23.5\% Latino, 16.4\% other). We compared lesbian and gay
   (1.2\%), bisexual (3.5\%), and unsure (2.6\%) youths with heterosexuals
   (92.7\%) on a binary indicator of passenger safety belt use. We
   stratified weighted multivariable logistic regression models by sex and
   adjusted for survey wave and sampling design.
   Results. Overall, 12.6\% of high school students reported ``rarely{''}
   or ``never{''} wearing safety belts. Sexual minority youths had
   increased odds of reporting nonuse relative to heterosexuals (48\%
   higher for male bisexuals, 85\% for lesbians, 46\% for female bisexuals,
   and 51\% for female unsure youths; P < .05), after adjustment for
   demographic (age, race/ethnicity), individual (body mass index,
   depression, bullying, binge drinking, riding with a drunk driver,
   academic achievement), and contextual (living in jurisdictions with
   secondary or primary safety belt laws, percentage below poverty,
   percentage same-sex households) risk factors.
   Conclusions. Public health interventions should address sexual
   orientation identity disparities in safety belt use.}},

Journal = {{INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Working memory has been consistently associated with mathematics
   achievement, although the etiology of these relations remains poorly
   understood. The present study examined the genetic and environmental
   underpinnings of math story problem solving, timed calculation, and
   untimed calculation alongside working memory components in 12-year-old
   monozygotic (n = 105) and same-sex dizygotic (n = 143) twin pairs.
   Results indicated significant phenotypic correlation between each
   working memory component and all mathematics outcomes (r = 0.18-033).
   Additive genetic influences shared between the visuo-spatial sketchpad
   and mathematics achievement were significant, accounting for roughly
   89\% of the observed correlation. In addition, genetic covariance was
   found between the phonological loop and math story problem solving. In
   contrast, despite there being a significant observed relationship
   between phonological loop and timed and untimed calculations, there was
   no significant genetic or environmental covariance between the
   phonological loop and timed or untimed calculation skills. Further
   analyses indicated that genetic overlap between the visuo-spatial
   sketchpad and math story problem solving and math fluency was distinct
   from general genetic factors, whereas g, phonological loop, and
   mathematics shared generalist genes. Thus, although each working memory
   component was related to mathematics, the etiology of their
   relationships may be distinct. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc, All rights

   explicating the messages received and the representations shaped by
   Rock-port's hegemonic masculine curriculum and the embodiment of these
   dynamics through research on bullying conducted with students and
   faculty at an elite, single-sex independent boys school, Rockport. The
   data revealed that bullying between boys at Rockport helped to
   discipline and reproduce hegemonic masculine boundaries; it was as much
   an expression of Rockport's culture as it was a vehicle for policing and
   reproducing its culture. However, not only were the boys within Rockport
   gendered, the faculty and even the institution itself was gendered. In
   this way, it was systemic, both students and faculty acted within this
   institutional culture and held and managed expectations about their

   same-sex pretend play were better liked by peers and were viewed by
   teachers as being socially competent. In addition, girls who engaged in
   same-sex exercise play and boys who engaged in same-sex rough-and-tumble
   play were better liked by peers, whereas boys who engaged in
   rough-and-tumble play with other-sex peers were less liked by peers. The
   results suggest that child gender and gender of playmate are important

Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{607-619}},

Abstract = {{Against the background of increasing concern about levels of physical
   activity among young people, this paper reports the results of a
   cross-national comparison between two longitudinal studies of young
   people in Glasgow, Scotland and Dunedin, New Zealand, which used similar
   methods of assessment at 15 and 18 years of age. The comparison revealed
   that, on average, young people in Dunedin participated in a greater
   range of activities, encompassing both organised sports and informal
   activities such as cycling, and with greater frequency than those in
   Glasgow at both ages, but particularly so at age 18. The difference was
   especially marked for females, among whom one in three in Glasgow
   reported no physical activity at all at age 18. By contrast, in both
   sexes among those who did participate, much less difference in levels of
   involvement was observed between the two locations. Of 35 activities,
   only in respect of soccer, and only for males, did participation and
   involvement in Glasgow exceed that of Dunedin. Neither climatic factors,
   natural features of the environment, socio-economic composition, nor
   different proportions in single-sex/co-educational schooling explain the
   difference in levels of participation between the two locations.
   Participation rates in selected physical activities do, however, reflect
   different opportunity structures in Dunedin and Glasgow, with an
   advantage accruing to the former in respect of both school and
   post-school provision, Cultural factors, which underpin such
   differences, also appear to have an additional influence on
   participation, most notably in relation to the gender gap in physical
   activities, much bigger in Glasgow than Dunedin. To redress these
   differences requires an increase in levels of participation generally,
   particularly among females, which depends as much on a shift in values
   about physical activity as on the provision of better resources. (C)

Title = {{Teaching Sodomy in a Carolingian Monastery: A Study of Walahfrid
   Strabo's and Heito's Visio Wettini}},

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3, SI}},

Abstract = {{In 824 the monk and teacher Wetti of Reichenau experienced a terrifying
   vision in which an angel led him through an afterlife where monks,
   clerics and laypeople experienced a variety of temporal and eternal
   punishments. Only the intercession of saints, martyrs and virgins saves
   Wetti, who would have been irrevocably doomed because he had corrupted
   his students through his teaching, his bad example and his deeds.
   Wetti's fellow monk Heito wrote a widely circulated prose version of
   this vision, which the Carolingian scholar Walahfrid Strabo later turned
   into an apparently metric version. Both versions extensively address the
   scelus sodomiticum (the crime of sodomy) but express fundamentally
   different viewpoints on the nature, the moral assessment and the dangers
   of same-sex sexuality in a monastic context. Heito implies that Wetti
   exposed himself and his students to the danger of eternal damnation
   through practising or at least facilitating sodomy. Walahfrid manages
   through a number of subtle alterations to acquit Wetti and his school
   from allegations of sodomy and to turn the scelus sodomiticum into an
   individual fault rather than a threat to the community and to monastic
   purity in general. Comparing the two versions of the Visio Wettini
   provides new insights into the medieval monastic classroom as a queer
   space, medieval assessments of same-sex desire, the role of classical
   learning in the monastic curriculum and the construction of monastic
   purity.}},

Title = {{Does Coping Mediate the Relationship Between Adolescent-Parent

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHILD AND FAMILY STUDIES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{479-489}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The primary goal of this study was to examine the relationship between
   adolescent-parent communication and adolescent internalizing problems.
   Both gender of the adolescent and gender or the parent were considered.
   An additional goal was to explore whether coping skills mediated this
   relationship. The sample included a community sample of 980 U.S. high
   school students. Surveys were administered during three annual
   assessment waves in seven public high schools during the spring of 2007
   (Time 1), 2008 (Time 2), and 2009 (Time 3). Path analysis results
   indicated significant direct effects only for same-sex adolescent-parent
   dyads. For boys, adolescent-father communication predicted depressive
   and anxiety symptoms. Coping did not mediate these relationships. For
   girls, adolescent-mother communication predicted anxiety symptoms.
   Further, this relationship was mediated by humor coping.
   Adolescent-mother communication also predicted depressive symptoms via
   instrumental social support for girls. These results align with social
   learning theory and suggest that family-based interventions with
   same-sex adolescent-parent dyads are warranted to prevent internalizing
   problems in adolescents.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{Data from the 2010 Minnesota Student Survey was analyzed to identify
   risk and protective factors that distinguished adolescents across three
   groups: no suicidality, suicidal ideation only, and suicide attempt. The
   population-based sample included 70,022 students in grades 9 and 12.
   Hopelessness and depressive symptoms emerged as important risk factors
   to distinguish youth who reported suicidal ideation or behavior from
   those without a history of suicidality. However, these factors were not
   as important in differentiating adolescents who attempted suicidal from
   those who considered suicide but did not act on their thoughts. Instead,
   for both genders, self-injury represented the most important factor to
   distinguish these youth. Other risk factors that differentiated the
   latter groups, but not the former groups, for males were dating violence
   victimization and cigarette smoking, and for females was a same-sex
   sexual experience. Running away from home also seemed to increase the
   risk of a suicide attempt among youth in this study. Parent
   connectedness and academic achievement emerged as important protective
   factors to differentiate all the groups, yet neighborhood safety
   appeared to protect against the transition from suicidal thoughts to
   behavior. Findings from this study suggest risk and protective factors
   practitioners should target in clinical assessments and intervention
   programs to help prevent suicidal behavior among youth at greatest risk.}},

Abstract = {{This article is concerned with the links between space, gender and
   adolescents' bodies. Drawing on data from both qualitative and
   quantitative research carried out with adolescents aged 13-16 in
   Liverpool, UK in 2001 the article examines girls' low participation
   rates in physical education (PE). Framed within theoretical work
   relating to the performance of corporeal femininities and `inhibited
   intentionality' in reference to sporting confidence, girls' experiences
   of single-sex PE are compared with their perceptions of mixed PE in
   order to explore how the presence of boys may impact on girls',
   perceptions of their bodies and willingness to participate in sport. The
   results suggest that while girls still feel pressure from a male gaze to
   present their bodies to boys as passively beautiful, they also feel
   pressure to be competent at sport and thus present their bodies as
   active. However, single-sex PE does not provide a space where the male
   gaze is absent, suggesting this gaze has been internalized. This article
   explores the nature of school space in explaining differential
   participation rates, highlighting how sports within the space of the
   school, with an emphasis on competition and under the evaluative gaze of
   teachers, intensify some girls' fears of inadequacy in sports. The
   findings illustrate the complexities and contradictions present within
   and between girls' experiences of their bodies and sports and the
   relationship between school space and adolescents' bodies.}},

   endorsement of sex-role stereotypes, and family composition. Subjects
   were 723 third and fourth graders (377 girls, 346 bays) from diverse
   socioeconomic backgrounds; 35\% were African American. Measures included
   sociometric assessments of peer acceptance, friendship, and behavioral
   reputation, as well as self-reports of perceived self-competence and
   endorsement of sex-role stereotypes. In addition, teachers completed
   ratings of children's social and cognitive competence. In all, 92
   children, about 14\% of the sample, had one or more reciprocal
   opposite-sex friends; for 21 of these children, their cross-sex
   friendships were their primary or only friendships. African American
   children were more likely than European American children to have
   opposite-sex friends. Involvement in cross-sex friendships was unrelated
   to the gender make-up of the classroom, but was related to family
   structure. Comparisons of the children who had primarily or only
   cross-sex friends to matched groups of children who had only same-sex
   friends and to children who had cross-sex friends secondarily to
   same-sex ones revealed a number of differences between the groups in
   social competence and relationships with peers. Overall, children with
   primarily opposite-sex friends had poorer social skills than other
   children with friends, although they were less stereotyped about sex
   roles than other children, and were better adjusted than children with
   no friends on most measures. In contrast, children involved in
   opposite-sex friendship secondarily to same-sex friendship were as well
   adjusted socially as children with only same-sex friendships. These
   results suggest that children with cross-sex friends differ among
   themselves, depending on the primacy of the cross-sex relationship.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to evaluate whether twinning might influence handedness
   and the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to
   handedness in a total of 321 pairs of twins, 36 same-sex sib-pairs, and
   1020 singletons, aged 12-16 and systematically recruited from the junior
   high schools in Taipei. Twins' zygosity was determined by a combination
   of DNA typing and physical similarity. The direction and consistency of
   handedness in twins did not differ from that seen in singletons.
   Compared with the full model containing additive genes (A), shared (C),
   and non-shared (E) environment, both AE and CE models had equivalently
   acceptable fit. The contribution from additive genes in the AE model was
   estimated to be 16\% (directional) to 13\% (consistent) for the
   continuous handedness and 34-10\% for the categorical one, whereas the
   corresponding contribution from shared environment in the CE model was
   14-14\% and 32-11\%, respectively. Handedness in adolescents appears to
   be not influenced by twinning and not substantially heritable, whereas
   environmental factors, especially those not shared between siblings, are
   the most important ones for explaining individual variations.}},

Abstract = {{A representative community sample of Hong Kong boys (n = 1, 024) and
   girls ( n = 1, 403), age 14 18 years, provided information regarding
   same-sex attraction, gender dissatisfaction, pubertal timing, early
   experience with sexual intercourse, and depressive symptoms. They also
   rated the quality of their family and peer relationships and
   self-perceived attractiveness. Depressive symptoms were higher in youths
   reporting same-sex attraction, gender dissatisfaction, early pubertal
   maturation, and early sexual intercourse. Family relationships were less
   satisfactory for those who reported same-sex attraction, gender
   dissatisfaction, and early sexual intercourse, and peer relationships
   were also worse for those who reported gender dissatisfaction. In
   multivariate analyses, same-sex attraction, early sexual intercourse,
   and early pubertal maturation were unique and direct contributors to
   depressive symptoms; however, gender dissatisfaction's association with
   depressive symptoms was largely accounted for by shared correlations
   with negative family and peer relationships. The multivariate model
   explained 11\% of the variance of depressive symptoms. These findings
   offer a preliminary documentation of the prevalence and correlates of
   atypical sexual self-assessments and behavior among adolescents in Hong
   Kong. Such information is important if theories of sexual identity and
   risk factors for depressive symptoms are to have cross-cultural utility.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties
   of the Matthews Youth Test for Health (MYTH) as a measure of components
   of Type A behavior in school-age children.  The sample consisted of 216
   middle-class, white, 6 to 11 year old, same-sex twin children.  Pairs
   were randomly split into two subgroups for cross-validation.  The MYTH
   was completed by 88\% of the children's teachers.  The Perceived
   Competence Scale was completed by 118 of the 124 children 8 to 11 years
   old; a parallel form of this instrument was completed by teachers of 108
   of these children.  The 17 items of the MYTH instrument were factor
   analyzed.  Two factors, Impatience-Aggression and Competitive
   Achievement-Striving, were derived and cross-validated.  These MYTH
   factors were internally consistent and replicated previous studies of
   school-age children.  The construct validity of the MYTH subscales was
   partially supported by evidence of relationships between these
   components of Type A behavior and teacher-ratings of the child's
   competence in specific domains.  Children's ratings of their competence
   and perceptions of global self-worth were not related to total MYTH
   scores or subscale scores.}},

Title = {{Prevalence and factors associated with depression symptoms among
   school-going adolescents in Central Uganda}},
Journal = {{CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND MENTAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Depression in adolescents constitutes a global public health
   concern. However, data on its prevalence and associated factors are
   limited in low income countries like Uganda.
   Methods: Using a cross-sectional descriptive study design, 519
   adolescent students in 4 secondary schools in Mukono district, Uganda,
   were randomly selected after meeting study criteria. The 4 school types
   were: boarding mixed (boys and girls) school; day mixed school; girls'
   only boarding school; and, boys' only boarding school. The 519
   participants filled out standardized questionnaires regarding their
   socio-demographic characteristics and health history. They were then
   screened for depression using the Children Depression Inventory (CDI)
   and those with a cut-off of 19 were administered the Mini International
   Neuro-Psychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents 2.0 (MINI-KID),
   to ascertain the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
   4th Edition (DSM IV) diagnostic types of depression and any co
   morbidity. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess factors
   associated with significant depression symptoms (a score of 19 or more
   on the CDI).
   Results: There were 301 (58 \%) boys and 218 (42 \%) girls with age
   range 14-16 years and a mean age of 16 years (SD 2.18). Of 519
   participants screened with the CDI, 109 (21 \%) had significant
   depression symptoms. Of the 109 participants with significant depression
   symptoms, only 74 were evaluated with the MINI-KID and of these, 8 (11
   \%) met criteria for major depression and 6 (8 \%) met criteria for
   dysthymia. Therefore, among participants that were assessed with both
   the CDI and the MINI-KID (n = 484), the prevalence of depressive
   disorders was 2.9 \%. In this sample, 15 (3.1 \%) reported current
   suicidal ideation. In the logistic regression analyses, significant
   depression symptoms were associated with single-sex schools, loss of
   parents and alcohol consumption.
   Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study therefore, causal
   relationships are difficult to establish. Limited resources and the lack
   of collateral information precluded the assessment of a number of
   potential factors that could be associated with adolescent depression.
   The MINI-KID was administered to only 74 out of 109 students who scored
   = 19 on the CDI since 35 students could not be traced again due to
   limited resources at the time.
   Conclusions: Significant depression symptoms are prevalent among
   school-going adolescents and may progress to full-blown depressive
   disorders. Culturally sensitive psychological interventions to prevent
   and treat depression among school-going adolescents are urgently needed.}},

   Novels}},

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{89-105}},
Abstract = {{This article examines the ethical force and function of same-sex
   relationships in a ten-volume sequence of English children's books,
   published between 1948 and 1982, by Antonia Forest (pseudonym for
   Patricia Rubinstein, 1915-2003). From the late 1940s onwards, Forest's
   fiction articulates what Adrienne Rich theorizes in her classic work of
   lesbian ethics, ``Women and Honor: Some Notes on Lying{''} (1975): the
   idea of same-sex bonds as the locus and standard of the ethical. Through
   the characters of the Marlow family (six sisters, two brothers) and
   their friends and enemies, Forest explores questions of honesty and
   self-deception, fidelity (both religious and personal) and betrayal,
   integrity and duality, performance and the boundaries of the self.
   Forest's exploration of these questions is persistently inflected by a
   resistance to heterosexuality and by a privileging of same-sex bonds,
   whether female or male. Forest's resistance to the pressures of
   conventional pieties and expected emotions, whether about love,
   friendship or the family, makes these books particularly important for
   lesbian readers. (C) 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights

Journal = {{SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{464-477}},
Abstract = {{Drawings of `a person' and of `a person playing music' were collected
   from children aged seven to eight years and 10-11 years to discover
   whether children's musical representations would reflect gender
   differences evident in musical learning and performance, and the
   increased gender rigidity with age found in instrument preferences. As
   in previous drawing studies, same sex figures were overwhelmingly
   portrayed, although older girls drew more opposite sex figures than the
   other children. All except the older girls overwhelmingly drew same sex
   musicians irrespective of the gender stereotype of the instrument
   portrayed. The older girls drew similar numbers of male and female
   figures playing masculine instruments. Fewer feminine instruments were
   drawn by older than by younger boys. The increased gender rigidity with
   age accords with the results of the preference studies, but gender
   stereotyping was much weaker. This is discussed in relation to what the
   different methodologies measure.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the effects of a family intervention on
   victimization and emotional distress of children bullied by peers. The
   intervention, Resilience Triple P. combined facilitative parenting and
   teaching children social and emotional skills relevant to developing
   strong peer relationships and addressing problems with peers.
   Facilitative parenting is parenting that supports the development of
   children's peer relationship skills. A randomized controlled trial was
   conducted with 111 families who reported chronic bullying of children
   aged 6 to 12 years. Families were randomly allocated to either an
   immediate start to Resilience Triple P (RTP) or an assessment control
   (AC) condition. Assessments involving children, parents, teachers, and
   observational measures were conducted at 0 (pre), 3 (post) and 9 months
   follow-up. RTP families had significantly greater improvements than AC
   families on measures of victimization, child distress, child peer and
   family relationships, including teacher reports of overt victimization
   (d = 0.56), child internalizing feelings (d = 0.59), depressive symptoms
   (d = 0.56), child overt aggression towards peers (d = 0.51), acceptance
   by same sex and opposite sex peers (d = 0.46/ 0.60), and child liking
   school (d = 0.65). Families in both conditions showed significant
   improvements on most variables over time including child reports of
   bullying in the last week reducing to a near zero and indistinguishable
   from the normative sample. The intervention combining facilitative
   parenting and social and emotional skills training for children produced
   better results than the comparison assessment control condition. This
   study demonstrated that family interventions can reduce victimization
   and distress and strengthen school efforts to address bullying.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to highlight the important role that
   gender plays in organizing and affecting the quality of the classroom
   climate. We review research showing how students' peer relationships
   tend to be segregated by gender and discuss the consequences of children
   spending much of their time almost exclusively with same-gender peers,
   which perpetuates and exaggerates gender segregation. We suggest that a
   more beneficial pattern is enhancing students' exposure to other-gender
   peers-that is, promoting gender integration. We describe the theories
   that support the benefits of integrating across social groups. Next, we
   review methods and results of strategies we have used to promote
   integration. Finally, we draw attention to the issues about gender
   integration that require further consideration and argue for more
   research that can help guide the development of effective strategies
   that build more inclusive environments, practices, and policies for
   today's children and youth.}},

   While Doing Math Exercises Online}},
Journal = {{EDUCATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{When in doubt, asking a peer can be very helpful. Students learn a lot
   of social strategies from peers. However, stated preference studies have
   found that for elementary school students with math questions, they
   prefer to ask their teacher for help. In this paper, we study revealed
   preferences instead of stated preferences. We analyzed the behavior of
   fourth-grade students seeking face-to-face assistance while working on
   an online math platform. Students started by working independently on
   the platform, before the teacher selected two or three tutors from among
   those who have answered 10 questions correctly. Each student was then
   able to choose between the teacher or one of these tutors when
   requesting assistance. We studied the students' preferences over 3
   years, involving 88 fourth-grade classes, 2700 students, 1209 sessions
   with classmate tutors, and a total of 16,485 requests for help when
   there was an option to choose between a teacher or a classmate. We found
   that students prefer asking classmates for help three times more than
   asking their teachers when given the choice. Furthermore, this gap
   increases from the first to the second semester. We also found that
   students prefer to request help from classmates of the same sex and of
   higher academic performance. In this context, students from the two
   highest tertiles sought help from classmates in the same two tertiles,
   and students from the medium tertile prefer to seek help from students
   of the highest tertile. However, students in the two lowest tertiles do
   not prefer asking for help from students from the top tertile more than
   from their own tertiles.}},

Abstract = {{The current study examined three hypotheses about experience in close
   friendships and psychosocial adjustment. At Time 1, 51 same-sex close
   friend dyads (n = 102 friends, 51\% female, mean age = 20 years)
   completed self-report measures and participated in a brief observational
   assessment. The hypothesis that friendship quality would be associated
   with clinical symptomatology and self-esteem was supported and indicated
   that high levels of negative friendship features were positively
   associated with clinical symptoms, whereas positive features were most
   strongly associated with self-esteem. The second hypothesis that changes
   in the friendship would be associated with adjustment one year later
   (68\% participation rate at Time 2) was supported only for interpersonal
   sensitivity such that perceived negative changes in the relationship
   predicted increased symptoms. Finally, friends' perceptions of the
   features and quality of their relationship were somewhat consistent, yet
   as hypothesized, discordant perceptions predicted higher symptomatology
   and lower social support and satisfaction in the relationship. The
   results highlight the importance of considering both positive and
   negative aspects of friendship in early adulthood.}},

Journal = {{EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{425-438}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study deals with the application of concept mapping to
   the teaching and learning of a science topic with secondary school
   students in Germany.
   Purpose: The main research questions were: (1) Do different teaching
   approaches affect concept map structure or students' learning success?
   (2) Is the structure of concept maps influenced by gender? (3) Is the
   concept map structure a reliable indicator of students' learning
   success?
   Sample: One hundred and forty-nine high-achieving 5th-grade students
   from four German secondary schools participated in the study. The
   average age of participants was 10 years. Gender distribution was
   balanced. Students produced concept maps working in small, single-sex
   groups.
   Design and methods: There were two teaching approaches used: one based
   upon teacher-centred instruction and one consisting of student-centred
   learning. Both were followed by a concept-mapping phase. Student groups
   experienced either one or the other teaching approach. Concept map
   structures were analysed using of the method of Kinchin, Hay and Adams.
   We defined three different possible types of concept map structure:
   spokes, chains and nets. Furthermore, for assessing a student's
   short-and longer-term learning success, we constructed a multiple-choice
   knowledge test applied in a pre-, post-, retention-test design.
   Parametric tests, such as MANOVA, one-way ANOVA and t-tests were used to
   identify any differences in gender, teaching approach, number of nets
   per concept map and their interactions.
   Results: Type of teaching approach had an effect on concept map
   structure but not on students' longer-term learning success. Students of
   the teacher-centred approach produced more net structures than those
   students who participated in the hands-on instruction. Subsequent
   analyses showed in total more net structures for female groups. The
   interaction of gender and number of nets per concept map showed a
   significant effect on students' longer-term learning success.
   Conclusion: The study suggests that Kinchin's classification scheme for
   assessing concept map quality may be a good indicator of students'
   learning success when applied in combination with a knowledge test.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies comparing cognitive abilities between contemporary twins
   and singletons in developed countries have suggested that twin deficits
   in cognitive abilities no longer exist. We examined cognitive abilities
   in a sample of twins and singletons born recently in Nigeria to
   determine whether recent findings can be replicated in developing
   countries. Our sample consisted of 413 pairs of twins and 280 singletons
   collected from over 45 public schools in Abuja and its neighboring
   states in Nigeria. The ages of twins and singletons ranged from 9 to 20
   years with a mean (SD) of 14.6 years (2.2 years) for twins and 16.1
   years (1.8 years) for singletons. Zygosity of the same-sex twins was
   determined by analysis of 16 deoxyribonucleic acid markers. We asked
   participants to complete a questionnaire booklet that included Standard
   Progressive Matrices-Plus Version (SPM+), Mill-Hill Vocabulary Scale
   (MHV), Family Assets Questionnaire, and demographic questions. The data
   were corrected for sex and age and then analyzed using maximum
   likelihood model-fitting analysis. Although twins and singletons were
   comparable in family social class indicators, singletons did better than
   twins across all the tests (d = 0.10 to 0.35). The average of d for SPM+
   total {[}0.32; equivalent to 4.8 Intelligence Quotient (IQ) points] and
   d for MHV (0.24; equivalent to 3.6 IQ points) was 0.28 (equivalent to
   4.2 IQ points), similar to the twin-singleton gap found in old cohorts
   in developed countries. We speculate that malnutrition, poor health, and
   educational systems in Nigeria may explain the persistence of twin
   deficits in cognitive abilities found in our sample.}},

   cross-race mutual friends, African-American children were more accepting
   of European-American children than the reverse. Despite some same-race
   preferences, cross-race evaluations were generally quite positive on
   both measures. The differential impact of sex and race as considerations
   for peer evaluations is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to identify, the critical elements of
   adolescent girls' culture and to identify, the impact of this culture on
   leisure behavior within an adventure education setting. Qualitative
   methods, specifically ethnographic focus groups and participant
   observation, were chosen as the most appropriate means to accomplish the
   goals of the study. The results suggest that adolescent girls see their
   world in terms of absolutes. Further, of the three innate psychological
   needs serving as the basis for intrinsically motivated behavior (Deci \&
   Ryan, 1991), relatedness is the most critical concern for adolescent
   girls. Until this relatedness is achieved, it is unlikely that the goals
   of adventure and other recreation programs will be addressed or that
   girls will truly experience leisure. This overriding desire for status
   and acceptance, which was established as the theme of adolescent girls'
   culture, can be most accurately described as ``social dependency{''}.}},

Abstract = {{In taking heed of the so-called spatial turn' in social theory this
   paper explores how the spatial intersects with boys' performances of
   gender and (dis)pleasures in school physical education (PE). In
   particular, the paper aims to contribute to our understanding of how the
   organisation and implementation of physical and social spaces in PE can
   be seen as enabling or restricting boys' participation and enjoyment in
   this subject. The research setting was a multicultural single-sex boys'
   secondary school in Auckland, New Zealand which is widely known for its
   strong focus on sports and especially rugby. The data was generated
   through a participatory visual research approach involving video
   recordings, focus groups and individual interviews. In order to
   interpret the data I draw on Foucault's theorising of the disciplinary
   use of space, what he calls the art of distributions', to examine the
   co-construction of gender, space and (dis)pleasures within boys' PE. I
   demonstrate how through their performances of gender, as shaped by
   discourses and relations of power associated with sport and masculinity,
   the boys capitalise on the spaces of PE to highlight them as productive
   and pleasurable spaces.}},

Abstract = {{We describe two interventions designed to encourage community action
   with youth in a school and a community service setting. The school
   intervention took place with a Year 10 class, while the community-based
   intervention took place with a group of same-sex attracted youth. Using
   a participatory action research framework, youth in both settings
   devised a series of community Projects to Promote Personal, group, and
   community wellness. Projects included drama presentations addressing
   homophobia, designing an aboriginal public garden., children's
   activities in a cultural festival for rejugees, a drug-free underage
   dance party, a community theatre group, and a student battle of the
   hands. We evaluated the various community projects using se lf-reports,
   videotapes, and ethnographic data. Mile goals of personal and group
   wellness were meaningfully met, wellness at the community level was
   harder to achieve. Introducing a tool for the evaluation of
   psychopolitical validity, we examined the degree of both epistemic and
   transformational validity present in the interventions. Our assessment
   indicates that (a) psychological changes are easier to achieve than
   political transformations, (b) epistemic validity is easier to
   accomplish than transformational validity, and (c) changes at the
   personal and group levels are easier to achieve than changes at the
   community level. (D 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined relationships between timing of gay-related
   developmental milestones, early abuse, and emergence of poor health
   outcomes in adulthood among 1,383 gay/bisexual men in the Urban Men's
   Health Study. Latent Profile Analysis grouped participants as developing
   early, middle or late based on the achievement of four phenomena
   including age of first awareness of same-sex sexual attractions and
   disclosure of sexual orientation. Participants who developed early were
   more likely, compared to others, to experience forced sex and
   gay-related harassment before adulthood. They were more likely to be HIV
   seropositive and experience gay-related victimization, partner abuse and
   depression during adulthood. Early forced-sex, gay-related harassment
   and physical abuse were associated with several negative health outcomes
   in adulthood including HIV infection, partner abuse, and depression.
   This analysis suggests that the experience of homophobic attacks against
   young gay/bisexual male youth helps to explain heightened rates of
   serious health problems among adult gay men.}},

   single-tons in the same classes, were followed from grade 3 at 10 years
   of age to grade 9 at 16 years of age in the Swedish compulsory school.
   The study was called the SLU-project (Skoloverstyrelsens och
   Lararhogskolans Utvecklingsprojekt) and the main purpose was to study
   physical and mental growth during puberty as well as heredity and
   environment influences on these growth processes. Originally 323 twin
   pairs, MZ and DZ, and 1193 controls were included in the sample. Among
   the DZ twin pairs there were both same-sex and opposite-sex pairs. They
   were a nationally representative sample. Several kinds of information
   were collected, such as, a) Physical measurements (height and weight
   measurements, menarche, ratings of secondary sex characteristics); b)
   Ability and achievement measures (intelligence tests, standardized
   achievement tests); c) Self ratings; d) Ratings by teachers and
   classmates; e) Socioeconomic background data (fathers occupation and
   income). For the boys, supplementary data on physical growth and mental
   ability was collected on enrollment to military service at the age of
   18. In this pilot-study, we have made a follow-up of the original
   SLU-sample after 20 years. They are now in their mid-thirties. The main
   purpose has been to investigate if they are willing to participate in a
   new study on health and well-being at mid-life.}},

   comparative evaluation (i.e. how the children evaluated their relative
   standing in class). These phenomena were examined at two time periods
   with a more detailed record of comparison choices while including
   several psychological moderators (i.e. closeness to and identification
   with the comparison targets, perceived academic control, importance of
   academic domains). The present findings (1) replicate those found
   earlier by Blanton and colleagues, (2) offer evidence that children
   compare upward with close friends with whom they identify as a means of
   self-improvement, (3) show that this identification is more likely to
   occur when children perceive control over their standing relative to the
   comparison target, and (4) suggest that the effects of comparison-level
   choice (i.e. the level typical of the persons with whom one chooses to

Abstract = {{Sexually explicit material (SEM) (including Internet, video, and print)
   may play a key role in the lives of Black same-sex sexually active youth
   by providing the only information to learn about sexual development.
   There is limited school- and/or family-based sex education to serve as
   models for sexual behaviors for Black youth. We describe the role SEM
   plays in the sexual development of a sample of Black same-sex attracted
   (SSA) young adolescent males ages 15-19. Adolescents recruited from
   clinics, social networking sites, and through snowball sampling were
   invited to participate in a 90-min, semi-structured qualitative
   interview. Most participants described using SEM prior to their first
   same-sex sexual experience. Participants described using SEM primarily
   for sexual development, including learning about sexual organs and
   function, the mechanics of same-gender sex, and to negotiate one's
   sexual identity. Secondary functions were to determine readiness for
   sex; to learn about sexual performance, including understanding sexual
   roles and responsibilities (e.g., ``top{''} or ``bottom{''}); to
   introduce sexual performance scripts; and to develop models for how sex
   should feel (e.g., pleasure and pain). Youth also described engaging in
   sexual behaviors (including condom non-use and/or swallowing ejaculate)
   that were modeled on SEM. Comprehensive sexuality education programs
   should be designed to address the unmet needs of young, Black SSA men,
   with explicit focus on sexual roles and behaviors that may be
   inaccurately portrayed and/or involve sexual risk-taking (such as
   unprotected anal intercourse and swallowing ejaculate) in SEM. This work
   also calls for development of Internet-based HIV/STI prevention
   strategies targeting young Black SSA men who may be accessing SEM.}},

   and substance use, family type was significantly associated only with
   self-esteem and conduct problems: Adolescents with lesbian mothers had
   higher levels of self-esteem and lower levels of conduct problems than

Abstract = {{This paper explores the interaction of ethnicity and friendship in a
   kindergarten in England. Existing literature from different traditions,
   such as developmental psychology, sociocultural theory and
   postmodernism, suggests that pre-school children tend to choose friends
   from the same ethnic group. The research was carried out using an
   ethnographic approach over the period of a year. The findings indicate
   that the children did play largely with others of the same sex and same
   ethnic origin. Children's friendships, sense of self and sense of other,
   it is suggested, emerged not from within but from experiences of the
   activities in which they did or did not engage. Hence the children's
   ethnic identities and friendships were shaped by the internalisation of
   what they saw and heard as they engaged in the kindergarten's
   activities. These led to the children's identities being performed and
   internalised in particular sorts of ways that marked out the children as
   familiar ('like us') or unfamiliar ('not like us') to others according
   to their previous experiences. Thus these identity performances in
   relation to the activities offered seemed to be internalised and to come
   to affect the friendships that children formed with each other.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to analyze the relationships between
   self-esteem, perceived stress, the quality of different types of
   interpersonal relationships, and gender in adolescents. This study used
   a sample of 1614 adolescent high school students and robust data
   analytic techniques to test the proposed relationships. The results
   partially supported the initial hypothesis in that perceived stress
   mediated the relationships between self-esteem and four of the types of
   interpersonal relationships (i.e., same-sex peer relationships,
   opposite-sex peer relationships, parent-child relationships, and
   teacher-student relationships) and moderated the relationship between
   self-esteem and same-sex peer relationships. In addition, a moderated
   role of gender was also partially supported in that perceived stress
   mediated the relationships between self-esteem and same-sex peer
   relationships, opposite-sex peer relationships, and the parent-child
   relationship for girls, but not boys. On the basis of these findings, it
   was concluded that perceived stress plays an intervening role in the
   relationship between self-esteem and different types of interpersonal
   relationships and that gender seems to be a moderator for some of the
   patterns of the relationships between these variables. These findings
   are discussed in light of the possible mechanisms by which the variables
   could influence each other. Implications for theory and practice as well
   as some directions for future research were also suggested.}},

Abstract = {{This paper surveys the research literature on stereotyping of gender and
   ICT and how it affects girls' participation in ICT education and work.
   Gender stereotypes can influence girls' choices over time, reducing
   their confidence and interest in ICT and turning them away from ICT as
   an occupation. The stereotypes can give negative messages about girls'
   aptitude for ICT work and the types of activities,which should interest
   them. ICT stereotypes are predominantly negative, provide misleading
   ideas about ICT as a career discouraging both girls and boys, and make
   the field particularly unattractive to girls. Stereotypes introduced in
   the family and social environment are often reinforced by images in the
   mass media as well as widespread education practices. Very few
   mitigating influences (such as same sex schools) have any impact on
   these stereotypes.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to estimate the relative contributions from genetic and

   performance, a widely used measurement for assessing frontal lobe
   function. Participants included 350 pairs of twins (257 MZ and 93 DZ)
   and 47 same-sex sib-pairs, aged 12-16 years, systematically recruited
   from junior high schools in Taipei. A computerized version of the WCST
   was administered for each participant and its nine indexes were used for
   subsequent analysis. Univariate analysis in structural equation modeling
   was performed for each WCST index using Mx program. The ACE model for
   each WCST index indicated no significant genetic influence, whereas the
   shared environmental influence ranged from 30 to 38\% for four indexes
   (Perseverative Errors, Perseverative Responses, Categories Achieved, and
   Conceptual Level Responses). We concluded that WCST performance might be
   an indicator more for environmental insult than for genetic influences
   on frontal lobe function.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated if and how children and teachers differ in their
   assessment of victim-aggressor relationships in kindergartens. Self-,
   peer, and teacher reports of victimization-aggression networks (who is
   victimized by whom) were investigated in 25 Swiss kindergartens with 402
   5- to 7-years-old. It was examined whether child characteristics (sex
   and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing behavior) influence
   informant reports of victimization and/or aggression. Findings from
   statistical network models indicated higher concordance between self and
   peer reports than between one of these and teacher reports. Results
   further showed more agreement among informants on aggressors than on
   victims. Aggressors reported by self and peer reports were low on
   internalizing behavior, and aggressors reported by self and teacher
   reports were high on externalizing behavior; teacher-reported victims
   were also high on externalizing behavior. Internalizing behavior was
   unrelated to victimization. According to self and peer reports, boys as
   well as girls were victimized by boys and girls equally; teachers
   reported less cross-sex victimization than same-sex victimization. The
   different views of teachers and children on victim-aggressor
   relationships have implications for the identification of aggression in
   early childhood. Mutual sharing of information between children, their
   parents, peers, and teachers may contribute to signaling victims and
   aggressors in the early school years.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescents' friendships with other-sex peers serve important
   developmental functions, but they may also facilitate engagement in
   problem behavior. This study examines the unique contributions of
   other-sex friendships and friends' behavior to alcohol use, smoking, and
   initiation of sexual intercourse among late adolescent girls and boys. A
   total of 320 adolescents (53\% girls; 33\% racial/ethnic minorities)
   provided sociometric nominations of friendships annually in grades
   10-12. Friendship networks were derived using social network analysis in
   each grade. Adolescents and their friends also reported on their alcohol
   use, smoking, and sexual debut at each assessment. After controlling for
   demographics, previous problem behavior, and friends' behavior,
   other-sex friendships in 10th grade were associated with initiation of
   smoking among girls over the following year, and other-sex friendships
   in 11th grade were linked with lower levels of subsequent alcohol use
   among boys. Additionally, friends' smoking and sexual experience in 10th
   grade predicted the same behaviors for all adolescents over the
   following year. Other-sex friendships thus appear to serve as a risk
   context for adolescent girls' smoking and a protective context for
   adolescent boys' drinking. Promoting mixed-gender activities and
   friendships among older high school students may be helpful in reducing
   males' alcohol use, but may need to incorporate additional components to
   prevent increases in females' smoking.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed children's overestimations of self-competence
   (positively biased self-perceptions or positive bias {[}PB]) relative to
   parent/teacher ratings of children's competence in predicting children's
   adjustment in a new setting. Eighty-five children (13 boys and 11 girls
   with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder {[}ADHD]; 30 boys and 31
   girls who were typically developing {[}TD]), ages 6.8 to 9.8 years (M =
   8.13; SD = 0.82), attended a 2-week summer day camp grouped into
   same-age, same-sex classrooms with previously unacquainted peers and
   counselors. Prior to camp, PB was assessed by creating standardized
   discrepancy scores between children's self-ratings relative to parent or
   teacher ratings of the children's social and behavioral competence. The
   relative ability of these discrepancy scores to predict peer preference
   and oppositionality at camp in relation to parent or teacher ratings
   alone was evaluated. For children with ADHD, both discrepancy scores and
   informant ratings of competence were uniquely predictive of peer
   preference and oppositionality assessed during camp. For TD children,
   only informant ratings of competence were predictive of outcomes at
   camp. These results suggest that PB may be a unique predictor of
   maladjustment within a novel environment for children with ADHD, but not
   TD children.}},

Abstract = {{Within physical education and sport, girls must navigate discourses of
   valued athletic and gendered bodies that marginalise or other'
   non-normative performances through systems of surveillance and
   punishment. The purpose of this paper is to share girls' perspectives on
   how these discourses affected their gender performances and activity
   engagement. Students aged 13-14 in one ethnically diverse UK secondary
   school were invited to create a photo diary of the physical activities
   they engaged in. Photo-elicitation interviews in small groups followed.
   The girls positioned themselves as physically active but had to
   carefully manage their activity choices and gender performances in a
   single-sex physical education environment that regulated deviation from
   the fit, slender, girly-girl. Although the girls demonstrate the
   difficulty of resisting, they indicate moments of positioning themselves
   against norms that suggest the possibilities of shifting gendering
   processes. The paper points out the importance of listening to other'
   girls' narratives in building positive physical education engagements.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to examine the cognitive, neurological
   and somatic developments of children who had in utero an absent or
   reversed end-diastolic blood flow (ABED) in the umbilical artery or an
   abnormal cerebroplacental ratio (ABF). Methods: 16 children with ABED
   blood flow and 15 children with ABF were each matched to children with
   the same gestational age, appropriate for gestational age, the same sex
   and born within 4 months. Data were assessed at the age of 3-6 years.
   Children with asphyxia, neonatal infection, malformation or major
   surgical interventions in the neonatal period were excluded. Each child
   underwent a neuropediatrical examination; furthermore, a Kaufman
   Assessment Battery for Children, a Snijders-Oomen Intelligence Scale for
   Children and a Man-Drawing Test were used to evaluate cognitive
   development. The socioeconomic status was also assessed. Results:
   Children in the ABED group remained lighter and had a higher frequency
   of microcephaly. In the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and the
   Snijders-Oomen Intelligence Scale for Young Children, cognitive
   development was impaired in the ARED and. the ABF groups compared to the
   control group. The ARED and the ABF groups, however, showed no
   differences. The Man-Drawing Test and the Denver Development Test did
   not show any differences. Discussion: ABED blood flow and ABF showed
   impaired cognitive development. The degree of impairment was the same in
   the ARED and the ABF groups. Long-term follow-up studies until adulthood
   are necessary to see if impaired cognitive development remains
   significant in these groups of patients. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The present experiment examined whether extra-task worry is associated
   with performance deficits in token individuals, and also examined
   whether deficits occur in the ongoing performance of group members who
   are distinctive along a nonvisual dimension. Female subjects took turns
   solving anagrams with three other same-sex participants who were
   identified as students belonging to the same school as the subject
   (nontoken condition) or as students from a rival institution (token
   condition). The three other participants were actually confederates who
   had been videotaped previously, thus ensuring that all subjects received
   the same standard treatment. The primary dependent measure of ongoing
   performance was the percentage of anagrams solved. Extra-task worry was
   assessed by examining how well subjects monitored the successes/failures
   of group participants. The principle hypothesis was that, relative to
   nontokens, tokens would display poorer problem-solving capability and
   enhanced performance monitoring behavior. The results corroborated past
   work and demonstrated that even nonperceptual distinctiveness is
   detrimental to the individual's cognitive capabilities: token subjects
   solved significantly fewer anagrams than nontokens. Moreover, the data
   on the monitoring task revealed that tokens were more adept than
   nontokens at tracking the performance of group members. Theoretical
   implications regarding the role of self-presentational concern in
   promoting cognitive deficits among tokens are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined the phenotypic and genetic relationship
   between fluency and non-fluency-based measures of reading and

   of same-sex MZ and DZ twins from Ohio. The present analyses are based on
   tester-administered measures available from 228 twin pairs (age M = 9.86
   years). Measurement models suggested that four factors represent the
   data, namely Decoding, Fluency, Comprehension, and Math. Subsequent
   quantitative genetic analyses of these latent factors suggested that a
   single genetic factor accounted for the covariance among these four
   latent factors. However, there were also unique genetic effects on
   Fluency and Math, independent from the common genetic factor. Thus,
   although there is a significant genetic overlap among different reading
   and math skills, there may be independent genetic sources of variation
   related to measures of decoding fluency and mathematics. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{The objective of this review is to focus on a neglected aspect of
   children's and adolescents' friendships: the level of temporal
   stability. First, a rationale for examining stability as a distinct
   friendship dimension is presented. Next, the different levels of
   friendship experiences are distinguished. Friendship stability is also
   discussed across developmental periods. Factors affecting friendships
   stability and individual correlates associated with friendship stability
   are then covered. Finally, the methodological issues pertaining to the
   study of friendship stability are addressed. The authors conclude by
   emphasizing the importance of pursuing future research that aims to
   demonstrate the pertinence of the friendship stability construct as an
   individual difference variable. Further, on a methodological level, the
   assessment of stability needs to be based on longitudinal designs that
   include multiple measurement waves. Ultimately, such detailed analysis
   of stability will allow a better understanding of the dynamic processes
   by which friendships change over time and affect children's and
   adolescents' psychosocial development. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study analyzes peer effects on childhood obesity using data from
   the first two waves of the IDEFICS study, which applies several

   children aged two to nine participating in both waves in 16 regions of
   eight European countries. Peers are defined as same-sex children in the

   in this European sample but that they differ among both regions and
   different fatness measures. Peer effects are larger in Spain, Italy, and
   Cyprus - the more collectivist regions in our sample - while waist
   circumference generally gives rise to larger peer effects than BMI. We
   also provide evidence that parental misperceptions of their own
   children's weight goes hand in hand With fatter peer groups, supporting
   the notion that in making such assessments, parents compare their
   children's weight with that of friends and schoolmates. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Analyzing 8169 contestants over 32 years of the US game show Jeopardy!,
   we find that women compete more aggressively, become (marginally) more
   competitive, and take on more risk when paired against men.
   Specifically, a woman is more likely to win a Jeopardy! episode and,
   within the show, to respond to a clue. Once responding, she is also
   marginally more likely to respond correctly. Potentially most
   surprising, even the sizeable gender gap in risk-taking (analyzing Daily
   Double wagering decisions) disappears once a woman competes in an
   otherwise all-male field of competitors. Men, on the other hand, wager
   significantly less when paired against women only, but the gender of
   opponents does not affect their competitive performance otherwise. Our
   rich sample allows us to control for a host of potentially confounding
   factors and player-fixed effects, thereby eliminating potential biases
   from unobservable individual characteristics. Our findings are
   consistent with an explanation that emphasizes an adaptation to ``social
   norms{''} applied to gender. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Children can control the expression of masculinity and femininity
   through the voice}},
Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Pre-pubertal boys and girls speak with acoustically different voices
   despite the absence of a clear anatomical dimorphism in the vocal
   apparatus, suggesting that a strong component of the expression of
   gender through the voice is behavioural. Initial evidence for this
   hypothesis was found in a previous study showing that children can alter
   their voice to sound like a boy or like a girl. However, whether they
   can spontaneously modulate these voice components within their own
   gender in order to vary the expression of their masculinity and
   femininity remained to be investigated. Here, seventy-two
   English-speaking children aged 6-10 were asked to give voice to child
   characters varying in masculine and feminine stereotypicality to
   investigate whether primary school children spontaneously adjust their
   sex-related cues in the voice-fundamental frequency (F0) and formant
   spacing (Delta F)-along gender stereotypical lines. Boys and girls
   masculinized their voice, by lowering F0 and Delta F, when impersonating
   stereotypically masculine child characters of the same sex. Girls and
   older boys also feminized their voice, by raising their F0 and Delta F,
   when impersonating stereotypically feminine same-sex child characters.
   These findings reveal that children have some knowledge of the sexually
   dimorphic acoustic cues underlying the expression of gender, and are
   capable of controlling them to modulate gender-related attributes,
   paving the way for the use of the voice as an implicit, objective
   measure of the development of gender stereotypes and behaviour.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{This article explores how gendered Chineseness is represented,
   circulated, and received in Huangmei musical films for audiences in
   martial-law Taiwan. Focusing on Love Eterne (1963), the analysis
   examines how theatrical impersonations in the film provided a queer
   social commentary on aspects of Chinese nationalism that conflicted with
   the Kuomintang's military masculinities. Love Eterne features dual
   layers of male impersonations: diegetically, the female character Zhu
   Yingtai masquerades as a man to attend school with other men;
   nondiegetically, the actress Ling Po performs the male character Liang
   Shanbo, Zhu's lover. In addition to the queer imagination generated by
   Ling's cross-dressing performance, the author considers how the feminine
   tone of Love Eterne allowed the Taiwanese audience to escape from
   masculine war preparations. Although the Kuomintang promoted Ling as a
   model patriotic actress, it was her background, similar to many
   Taiwanese adopted daughters, that attracted the most attention from
   female audiences. This female empathy and the queer subjectivity
   arguably disturbed the Kuomintang's political propaganda. Hence, this
   study adds to the breadth of queerness in studies on the cinematic
   performance of same-sex subjectivities and invites new understandings of
   queer performance in Love Eterne as a vehicle that can inspire
   alternative imaginings of gendered selfhoods and nations.}},

Abstract = {{Research concerning joint action for problem-solving on computer-based
   tasks in schools shows an increasing awareness that social context
   factors must be accounted for if cognitive development is to be
   effective. This study focuses on boys and girls working in single-sex or
   mixed-sex groups, and training for social skills as context factors and
   how these foci affect performance at the beginning and end of a school
   term (12 weeks). An experimental/observational methodology is adopted in
   preference to the I-P-I methodology which has dominated the literature
   in this area. Interactions most likely to achieve positive
   outcome/cognitive scores included elaborating discussion with little
   off-task talk. Training in a social skills programme helped increase
   outcome scores and positive interactions over the term. Exploration of
   sex differences did not provide the expected results. Males scored
   highest on the computer task at the start and end of term. Girls in
   mixed-sex groups scored better than girls working in girl-only groups.
   Girls who undertook social skills training showed the highest rate of
   improvement over the term. Finally, end of term results were co-varied
   by initial attainment on the computer task and showed that social skills
   training was a significant factor while downgrading sex differences to
   non-significance. Step-wise regression found initial attainment and
   social skills training provided the only significant contributions to
   the variance within final scores. Results suggest that teachers should
   not group pupils of low initial attainment together, that girls may work
   better in mixed-sex groups and that social skills training will benefit
   all pupils.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Suicide is a major public health problem and a complex
   clinical challenge. Assessment and early identification could be
   enhanced with screening tools that look beyond depression. The purpose
   of this study was to identify profiles of risk behaviors and social
   stress associated with suicidal ideation and behavior using the
   Behavioral Health Screen.
   Methods: The study used screening data from 2,513 primary care patients
   (aged 14-24 years). Data were collected between 2008 and 2012, and were
   analyzed in 2016.
   Results: Latent class analysis identified a high and low risk profile.
   Domains of primary influence included substance use, sexual assault,
   same-sex behavior, and unsafe sex. The high-risk group was 11 times more
   likely to have made a suicide attempt, five times more likely to report
   a history of suicidal ideation and behavior, and three times more likely
   to report recent suicidal ideation and behavior.
   Conclusions: Risk behaviors and social stress contribute to the risk for
   suicide above and beyond depression and should be assessed during
   routine primary care visits with adolescents. The Behavioral Health
   Screen can screen all these domains and thus assist primary care
   providers in assessing for both psychiatric and social stress factors
   associated with youth suicide. (C) 2017 American Journal of Preventive

Abstract = {{Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth experience multiple
   sexual health inequities driven, in part, by deficits in parental and
   peer support, school-based sex education programs, and community
   services. Research suggests that the Internet may be an important
   resource in the development of sexual health among LGBT youth. We
   examined the feasibility of recruiting youth in same-sex relationships
   into an online sexual health intervention, evaluated intervention
   acceptability, and obtained initial estimates of intervention efficacy.
   LGBT youth (16 to 20 years old) completed Queer Sex Ed (QSE), an online,
   multimedia sexual health intervention consisting of five modules. The
   final sample (N=202) completed the pretest, intervention, and posttest
   assessments. The primary study outcomes were sexual orientation identity
   and self-acceptance (e.g., coming-out self-efficacy), sexual health
   knowledge (e.g., sexual functioning), relationship variables (e.g.,
   communication skills), and safer sex (e.g., sexual assertiveness).
   Analyses indicated that 15 of the 17 outcomes were found to be
   significant (p<.05). Effect sizes ranged from small for sexual
   orientation (e.g., internalized homophobia) and relationship variables
   (e.g., communication skills) to moderate for safer sex (e.g.,
   contraceptive knowledge) outcomes. This study demonstrated the
   feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of QSE, an innovative

Abstract = {{This chapter discusses the methodological underpinnings of a doctoral
   study that examined boys' performances of gender in physical education
   (PE) at a single-sex secondary school in Auckland, New Zealand. Initial
   findings are also presented; however, they only serve to demonstrate the
   potential of such an approach and not as an exhaustive report of
   findings. Using a participatory visual research approach involving video
   recordings of boys participating in PE, the boys' representations and
   interpretations of the visual data were explored during both focus
   groups and individual interviews. The boys' visual representations and
   interpretations highlight how their performances of gender are embedded
   in the design and structure of the physical spaces and places associated
   with PE. Through a Foucauldian (poststructural) lens the boys' responses
   also illuminate how the gendered self is performed in multiple,
   contradictory and fluid ways involving particular technologies of the
   self. Visual research methods that focus on young people's visual
   representations and interpretations might help identify (gendered)
   identity issues that are seen as important to the students themselves.
   It creates a space for young people to critically think about, reflect,
   articulate, and reason their lived experiences, their relationships with
   their peers and more importantly themselves. The use of such research
   approaches has the potential of realizing one of the key aims of
   symbolic interactionism by opening up new analytical possibilities for
   understanding young people's lived experiences in both formal and
   informal pedagogical contexts.}},

Abstract = {{The ABCD twin study will elucidate the genetic and environmental
   contributions to a wide range of mental and physical health outcomes in
   children, including substance use, brain and behavioral development, and
   their interrelationship. Comparisons within and between monozygotic and
   dizygotic twin pairs, further powered by multiple assessments, provide
   information about genetic and environmental contributions to
   developmental associations, and enable stronger tests of causal
   hypotheses, than do comparisons involving unrelated children. Thus a
   sub-study of 800 pairs of same-sex twins was embedded within the overall
   Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) design. The ABCD Twin
   Hub comprises four leading centers for twin research in Minnesota,
   Colorado, Virginia, and Missouri. Each site is enrolling 200 twin pairs,
   as well as singletons. The twins are recruited from registries of all
   twin births in each State during 2006-2008. Singletons at each site are
   recruited following the same school-based procedures as the rest of the
   ABCD study. This paper describes the background and rationale for the
   ABCD twin study, the ascertainment of twin pairs and implementation
   strategy at each site, and the details of the proposed analytic
   strategies to quantify genetic and environmental influences and test
   hypotheses critical to the aims of the ABCD study.}},

   profiles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{593-606}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{ObjectiveOur study addressed three questions concerning the similarity
   of vocational interests within families: (a) How similar are vocational
   interests of mothers and fathers? (b) How similar are vocational
   interests of parents and their children? (c) Is the inference about
   parent-child profile similarity affected by mother-father profile
   similarity?
   MethodData from N=1,624 tenth graders and their parents were used to
   analyze interest profile similarity by means of a pseudo-coupling
   approach. Similarity was assessed on the level of observed profiles and
   model-based circumplex profiles.
   ResultsInterest profiles of mother-father and parent-child dyads were
   more similar to each other than those of corresponding arbitrarily
   paired dyads. However, when the similarity between the parents' interest
   profiles was accounted for, only same-sex parent-child dyads were more
   similar to each other than would be expected by chance. All findings
   were mirrored on the level of observed profiles and model-based
   circumplex profiles.
   ConclusionsIn sum, our findings support the validity of the circumplex
   model of vocational interests and emphasize the benefits of explicitly
   considering its implications when analyzing profile similarity.
   Moreover, we were able to show that the statistical evaluation of
   profile similarities must account for normative profile components.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual minority adolescent sexual risk behavior studies often overlook
   young women, do not consider behavior- and identity-based sexual
   orientation indicators in combination, and focus mainly on condomless
   sex. We examined multiple risk behaviors in a large sample of adolescent
   young men and women using combined behavior- and identity-based indices.
   The 2015 Dane County Youth Assessment data included 4734 students in 22
   high schools who had ever voluntarily engaged in sexual contact (51.7\%
   male; 76.0\% White, non-Hispanic). Items assessed having sex with
   unfamiliar partners, sex while using substances, using protection, and
   STI testing. Logistic regressions tested for disparities based on
   combined identity- and behavior-based sexual orientation indicators. For
   both young men and women, youth who reported heterosexual or questioning
   identities-but who had sex with same-sex partners-were at consistently
   greater risk than heterosexual youth with only different-sex partners.
   Also, for both young men and women, bisexuals with partners of both
   sexes more consistently reported higher risk than heterosexual youth
   than did bisexuals with only different-sex partners. Risk behavior for
   gay young men who had sex only with men mirrored those in extant
   literature. Risk levels differed for specific groups of sexual minority
   young women, thus deserving further attention. Findings underscore the
   need for sexual health research to consider sexual orientation in a more
   multidimensional manner.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Desirability for
   Control (DC) would influence young coaches' discourse and same age
   athletes' intrinsic motivation during peer tutoring interaction in a
   sport setting. Fifty-six participants were selected according to their
   high vs. low DC score. The following formula (mean +/- 0.75{*} standard
   deviation) was used to match participants in similar or dissimilar DC
   same-sex dyads in which a coach was asked to teach a technical skill to
   a novice athlete. Coaches' instructional style (support autonomy vs.
   control behaviors) was assessed through categorization of verbalizations
   and behaviors. Athletes' intrinsic motivation and their perception of
   the coach's intrinsic motivation were also assessed. Results of
   qualitative analyses showed that high DC coaches expressed higher scores
   on controlling style of instruction and demonstrations than low DC
   coaches. Controlling style of interactions was also higher for athletes
   who displayed a high DC. In addition high DC athletes were less exposed
   to coaches' demonstrations and controlling verbalizations when they were
   paired with low DC coaches. Finally, high DC athlete - low DC coach
   dyads entailed the highest scores in the athletes' intrinsic motivation
   and in their perceptions of the coach's intrinsic motivation. The need
   to consider desire for control with regards to pairing young coaches and
   same-age athletes and supervising what they say and act is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Grassroot Soccer (GRS) is exploring the effectiveness of a two-way SMS
   campaign delivered through a single-sex, soccer-based HIV prevention
   programme. The campaign aims to enhance reproductive health and rights
   outcomes among at-risk adolescent South African girls ages 11-14. To
   test and refine the SMS campaign prior to piloting, GRS employed a
   participatory process in building a prototype of an Unstructured
   Supplementary Service Data (USSD) line using Open Data Kit (ODK), an
   open-source application for building, collecting, and managing data on
   Android-enabled phones and tablets. The USSD prototype was delivered to
   72 female participants and coaches in July 2013. All participants also
   completed a 10-item questionnaire on ODK. Focus group discussions were
   conducted with coaches (N= 1 group) and parents (N= 1 group). Results
   demonstrate that 55\% of participants reported owning a mobile phone; a
   majority reported being ``very interested{''} in the USSD prototype
   (68\%) and ``very comfortable{''} interacting with the USSD prototype
   (62\%). Findings suggest that two-way SMSs could offer an acceptable
   service for reaching at-risk adolescent girls in South Africa with
   health-related messaging, particularly on sensitive issues. Results will
   inform delivery of a USSD line in a programmatic pilot and assessment to
   be carried out in six primary schools (approximately 600 participants)
   in Soweto, separated between control and intervention groups, beginning
   in September 2013.}},

Abstract = {{The manner in which individuals report their sexual attraction,
   self-label their sexual identity, or behave in sexual situations can
   vary over time, and particularly, adolescents may change their reported
   sexual attraction or sexual orientation identity over the course of
   their development. It is important to better understand the social
   factors that may influence these changes, such as one's religiosity. The
   present study thus aimed to assess the fluidity of adolescent romantic
   and sexual attraction over time and to explore the role of religiosity
   in this dynamic using two independent panel samples of Croatian high
   school students (N = 849 and N = 995). Response items for sexual and
   romantic attraction were categorized based on the Kinsey scale, and
   religiosity was assessed with a standard one-item indicator. Results
   demonstrated that changes in attraction were substantially more
   prevalent among non-exclusively heterosexual participants compared to
   exclusively heterosexual participants in both panels. Although more
   female than male adolescents reported non-heterosexual attraction,
   gender differences in attraction fluidity were inconsistent. Religiosity
   was associated with initial sexual attraction (more religious
   individuals were more likely to report exclusively heterosexual
   attraction), but not with changes in romantic and sexual attraction over
   time. Given that the understanding of adolescent sexual development can
   play an important role in reducing their vulnerability to sexual risk
   taking, stigmatization, and abuse, this study's findings have relevance
   for teachers, parents, and counselors working with adolescents, and in
   particular for sexual minority youth.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Gestational exposure to chemical mixtures, which is
   prevalent among pregnant women, may be associated with adverse childhood
   neurodevelopment. However, few studies have examined relations between
   gestational chemical mixture exposure and children's cognitive
   abilities. Methods: In a cohort of 253 pregnant women and their children
   from Cincinnati, OH (enrolled 2003-2006), we quantified biomarker
   concentrations of 43 metals, phthalates, phenols, polybrominated
   diphenyl ethers, organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides,
   polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluoroalkyl substances, and environmental
   tobacco smoke in blood or urine. Using k-means clustering and principal
   component (PC) analysis, we characterized chemical mixtures among
   pregnant women. We assessed children's cognitive abilities using the
   Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III and Wechsler
   Intelligence Scale for ChildrenIV at ages 5 and 8 years, respectively.
   We estimated covariate-adjusted differences in children's cognitive
   ability scores]=cross clusters, and with increasing PC scores and
   individual biomarker concentrations. Results: Geometric mean biomarker
   concentrations were generally highest, intermediate, and lowest among
   women in clusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Children born to women in
   clusters 1 and 2 had 5.1 (95\% CI: 9.4,-0.8) and 2.0 (95\% CI: 5.5, 1,4)
   lower performance IQ scores compared to children in cluster 3,
   respectively. PC scores and individual chemical biomarker concentrations
   were not associated with cognitive abilities. Conclusions: In this
   cohort, combined prenatal exposure to phenols, certain phthalates,
   pesticides, and perfluoroalkyl substances was inversely associated with
   children's cognition, but some individual chemical biomarker
   concentrations were not. Additional studies should determine if the
   aggregate impact of these chemicals on cognition is different from their
   individual effects.}},

Abstract = {{Background Research documents substantial adolescent health disparities
   by sexual orientation, but studies are confined to a small number of
   countries-chiefly the USA. We provide first-time evidence of
   associations between sexual orientation and adolescent health/well-being
   in a new country-Australia. We also add to knowledge by examining
   health/well-being outcomes not previously analysed in national samples,
   considering adolescents reporting no sexual attractions, and
   rank-ordering sexual-orientation health disparities by magnitude.
   Methods Data from an Australian national probability sample of 14/15
   years old (Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, n=3318) and
   regression models adjusted for confounding and for multiple comparisons
   were used to examine the associations between sexual attraction and 30
   outcomes spanning multiple domains of health/well-being-including
   socio-emotional functioning, health-related quality of life, depressive
   symptoms, health-related behaviours, social support, self-harm,
   suicidality, victimisation, self-concept, school belonging and global
   health/well-being assessments. Results Lesbian, gay, bisexual and
   questioning adolescents displayed significantly worse health/well-being
   than their heterosexual peers in all outcomes (p<0.05). The magnitude of
   the disparities ranged between 0.13 and 0.75 SD, and was largest in the
   domains of self-harm, suicidality, peer problems and emotional problems.
   There were fewer differences between the heterosexual and no-attraction
   groups. Worse outcomes were observed among both-sex-attracted
   adolescents compared with same-sex-attracted adolescents, and
   sexual-minority girls compared with sexual-minority boys. Conclusions
   Consistent with the minority stress model and recent international
   scholarship, sexual-minority status is an important risk factor for poor
   adolescent health/well-being across domains in Australia. Interventions
   aimed at addressing sexual-orientation health disparities within
   Australian adolescent populations are urgently required.}},

Title = {{Stigma Experiences, Mental Health, Perceived Parenting Competence, and
   Parent-Child Relationships Among Lesbian, Gay, and Heterosexual Adoptive
   Parents in the United States}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{Adoptive parents often face stigma related to ``non-traditional{''}
   family structures. Lesbian and gay (LG) adoptive parents often face
   additional stigmatization based on sexual identity, which in turn may
   negatively affect parents' mental health. Despite controversy about LG
   parenting, research demonstrates that family processes are more strongly
   associated with individual outcomes than family structure. Thus, family
   systems and minority stress theories provided our conceptual foundation
   in examining how adoptive LG parents' stigma experiences were associated
   with mental health, parenting competence, and parent-child
   relationships. Participating families (N = 106; n = 56 LG parent
   families) were originally recruited from five US domestic private infant
   adoption agencies and completed two waves of data collection (W1, W2;
   91\% retention) when children were preschool-age (M-age = 3.01 years)
   and school-age (M-age = 8.36 years), respectively. Data for the current
   study are largely drawn from W2. Via Qualtrics, parents completed
   assessments of mental health symptoms, adoption stigma, and perceived
   childcare competence. LG parents also reported on their experiences of
   homonegative microaggressions, and children responded to a measure about
   their relationships with parents. No significant differences emerged as
   a function of parental sexual orientation and gender except that lesbian
   mothers, heterosexual mothers, and gay fathers all reported higher
   parenting competence than heterosexual fathers. Although parents' mental
   health did not significantly predict parent-child relationship quality,
   parents' perceived competence and LG parents' current homonegative
   microaggression experiences did (e.g., greater competence, greater
   closeness; more microaggressions, lower closeness). Consistent with our
   conceptual framework, our results-derived from parent and child
   reports-demonstrate that although adoptive and LG parent families
   experience stigma, family processes (rather than structure) are most
   associated with individual outcomes. Researchers, policy makers, and
   practitioners should work together to employ identity-affirming
   practices to reduce stigma and support adoptive family functioning and
   well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging research suggests social attention in autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD) girls is enhanced relative to ASD boys but may also be affected by
   the type of social and nonsocial content presented. This study examined
   how biological sex and gender norms interact to influence visual
   attention in 79 school-aged children observing scenes that included
   gender-associated toys and actors of both sexes. Attention to social
   (faces) and object activity (hands with toys) stimuli was measured.
   Previously described distinctions between social attention in ASD boys
   and girls were replicated, with ASD girls looking more at faces than ASD
   boys. Irrespective of diagnosis, males and females attended more to
   actors that shared their same sex, and attended more to toys with
   gender-associations that were consistent with their own sex, suggesting
   that social and object salience increases for children under
   sex-consistent conditions. Importantly, ASD and typically developing
   (TD) children increased their gaze to faces when male actors were shown
   playing with female-associated toys, suggesting that both groups of
   children are sensitive to societal messages about the acceptability of
   males playing with female-associated toys. Our findings provide further
   evidence of heightened attention to faces in ASD girls relative to ASD
   boys, and indicate that social attention in ASD and TD children is
   influenced by who (male or female actor) and what (male- or
   female-associated toy) is being observed. Collectively, these results
   present a nuanced profile of attention in ASD that adds to a growing
   body of research indicating subtle phenotypic differences in ASD girls
   that may impact identification, assessment, and intervention. Autism Res
   2019. (c) 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley
   Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary Sex differences observed in typical
   development may also be present in individuals with autism. In this
   study, we developed an eye-tracking paradigm featuring videos of boys
   and girls playing with toys that varied in their gender associations.
   Attention to faces differed between autistic and non-autistic children
   but was also influenced by the sex of the actor and gender-association
   of toys. Autistic females demonstrated subtle attention differences that
   distinguished them from autistic males and may influence referral,
   diagnosis, and intervention.}},
