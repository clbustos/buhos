Abstract = {{This study was conducted to identify the language learning strategies
   based on academic achievement of boys and girls. The instruments of
   language learning strategies were distributed to 400 students, aged 15
   years old, of single gender schools and co-educational schools. The data
   were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Preliminary
   review of secondary data found that girls' academic achievement is
   consistently higher than boys' academic achievement in Malay and English
   language subjects. Furthermore, the language subject achievement of
   girls in co-educational schools is better than girls' achievement in
   single gender school. Multiple discriminant analysis also shows
   significant differences for all constructs of Malay language learning
   strategies; learning strategies inside the classroom, learning
   strategies outside the classroom and learning strategies prior to
   examination. This study provides an understanding of the trends and gaps
   in language subject achievement by gender and type of schools. This
   study also suggests the needs for creativity and innovation in
   pedagogical practices especially in language learning strategies.}},
