abstract={This study focuses on early childhood pre-service teacher education students as they engage with the BRiTE (Building Resilience in Teacher Education) modules during their studies. These modules are designed to provide pre-service teachers with a range of strategies to support their resilience. The BRiTE modules are integrated into subject content in each year of the degree. The study explores pre-service teachers’ capacity to exercise strategies and build resilience throughout their studies and during their Professional Experience placements. First-year students were surveyed about anticipated challenges in their initial placement following completion of the ‘Building Resilience’ and ‘Relationships’ modules. Eleven interviews were then undertaken with pre-service teachers across each year cohort, exploring individual stories of challenge and resilience whilst on placement. Analysis of responses revealed a range of challenges including the desire to ‘belong’ and develop relationships, which pre-service teachers managed in increasingly proactive ways as they took on teacher identity. Pre-service teachers identified strategies from the modules that they applied in their practice and had suggestions for effective ways to embed BRiTE in the degree. The study has implications for support of pre-service teachers preparatory to, and on, entering the profession. © 2019, The Australian Association for Research in Education, Inc.},

abstract={The purpose of the study is to examine professional identity of Turkish early childhood education teachers working in public and private preschools serving children from three to six years. The participants of the study, 1021 early childhood education teachers, were gathered through simple random sampling. The data for the study were gathered through A Professional Identity Scale (PRIS) (Kremer, L., & Hofman, J. E. (1985). Teachers’ professional identity and burn-out. Research in Education, 34, 89–95.), which is adapted into Turkish through preliminary psychometric investigation of its validity and reliability. Based on correlation analysis, independent samples t-test and analysis of variance gender, age, years of experience in occupation, age group of children, monthly income, educational level and background, job position and marital status of teachers were examined. Findings suggest that teachers’ professional identity was affected by such factors as gender, monthly income, educational level and background, job position, current work experience and marital status of teachers. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Purpose As teacher educators, we have long concerned ourselves with teachers' professional development. In this study, a collaborative-narrative approach was used to facilitate the professional development of preschool teachers. The aims were to explore the process of a collaborative-narrative approach, and to reconceptualize the preschool teachers' professional development. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted narrative inquiry. Researchers invited eight preschool teachers to form a "collaborative-narrative group," which focused on the narration of life and teaching stories in a course that spanned 18 months long. The group involved reading and narration, group interactions, dialogues and reflections, and discussions of difficulties encountered during teaching. Researchers' responsibilities were to encourage and guide the collaborators' engagement in narration, dialogues, and discussions. Data involving the process of the collaborative-narrative group were collected through observations, interviews, and document analysis, followed by a thematic analysis method to examine the collected data.Findings The study results showed that the key factors of the collaborative-narrative approach that facilitated the professional development of preschool teachers included the teachers' subjective attention, establishment of team cohesion, awareness and establishment of the teachers' identity, and reflective thinking conducted through a three-way interaction between the collaborators, researchers, course text. The approach for developing in-service preschool teachers' professional development education was reconceptualized through the idea of caring for and expanding life. This approach helped teachers develop a border-crossing identity between teacher and learner. Moreover, multiple reflections were conducted to deconstruct experience and convert it to knowledge. Finally, a diversified method was applied to acquire knowledge through triple narrative, reflections, dialogues, constructions, and actions. Originality/value Collaborative-narrative approach was seldom applies in preschool teachers professional development in Taiwan. This study develops the strategies of collaborative-narrative approach based on local school culture and context and proposes the recommendations for teacher education programs for preschool teachers. © 2014 CERE-NTNU.},

abstract={Abstract: This paper describes a memory and life story process engaged in by three former early childhood teachers. The reflective process was based in interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) and proceeded in a recursive and layered manner, circling around the participants’ memory narratives. The aims of the study were: (1) to develop a critical approach to generating knowledge about childhood, and (2) to consider a teaching strategy for memory work in teacher education programs. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This research explored the barriers in pedagogical relationships barriers that impact the learning of students living in poverty and that emerge from the voices of preschool, elementary, and special education teachers. The study's objective was to contribute to pre-service and in-service teacher education. A qualitative exploratory design was used individual and group interviews were conducted, and analysis showed that teachers refer to four aspects of students living in poverty: their limited views and expectations; homogeneous views; tensions concerning pedagogical knowledge and teacher identity; and cultural differences. The conclusion is that the main barrier is related to teachers' beliefs, which exert pressure on the cultural encounter of the school and the students' contexts.},

abstract={The teaching process cannot be simplified to definitions of the best teachers as those possessing certain desirable teaching behaviours and skills (Katz, 2002). Although there are numerous factors that significantly influence learning and teaching, one might agree that specific teaching roles dominantly determine the quality of preschool teaching processes and learning outcomes. Furthermore, two equally important dimensions that characterize teaching roles, as linked with concepts of identity, are professional and personal dimensions. Therefore, one might be wondering: Who are contemporary preschool teachers? How do they define their self and identity? What determines identity that preschool teachers describe as theirs? Consequently, how do these identities influence the quality of process of early and preschool care and education? Answering these questions is no easy task since the concept of identity is defined in various ways in the more general literature (Beijaard, Meijer, & Verloop, 2004). This chapter is focused on an analysis of preschool teacher identity from three specific aspects. First, since all identity models emphasize the cultural context within which preschool teachers' identity develops and its crucial role, contemporary changes in preschool teacher roles and a new study program called Early and Preschool Teacher Education and Care are analysed in the Croatian context. Secondly, in order to follow contemporary literature, theoretical models of identity are presented. Afterwards, based on such models, the personality traits and temperament of research participants are analysed within the context of preschool teacher identity. Finally, the chapter's third section analyses preschool teachers' values, motives, and narratives. In teaching, and perhaps especially in preschool teaching, the personal and the professional are intimately intertwined. These two aspects give each other significance, and are inexorably linked to the teacher's personal and professional identity. © 2016 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The teaching process cannot be simplified to definitions of the best teachers as those possessing certain desirable teaching behaviours and skills (Katz, 2002). Although there are numerous factors that significantly influence learning and teaching, one might agree that specific teaching roles dominantly determine the quality of preschool teaching processes and learning outcomes. Furthermore, two equally important dimensions that characterize teaching roles, as linked with concepts of identity, are professional and personal dimensions. Therefore, one might be wondering: Who are contemporary preschool teachers? How do they define their self and identity? What determines identity that preschool teachers describe as theirs? Consequently, how do these identities influence the quality of process of early and preschool care and education? Answering these questions is no easy task since the concept of identity is defined in various ways in the more general literature (Beijaard, Meijer, & Verloop, 2004). This chapter is focused on an analysis of preschool teacher identity from three specific aspects. First, since all identity models emphasize the cultural context within which preschool teachers' identity develops and its crucial role, contemporary changes in preschool teacher roles and a new study program called Early and Preschool Teacher Education and Care are analysed in the Croatian context. Secondly, in order to follow contemporary literature, theoretical models of identity are presented. Afterwards, based on such models, the personality traits and temperament of research participants are analysed within the context of preschool teacher identity. Finally, the chapter's third section analyses preschool teachers' values, motives, and narratives. © 2014 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the context of preparing early childhood teachers for a field with high attrition rates, this Canadian study examines pre-service teachers' identity expectations. Pre-service teachers wrote biographical narratives describing memories that influenced their reasons for choosing the teaching profession. Fifty-three narratives were analyzed. Implications from the study's findings suggest that teacher educators: 1) attend to the emotional dimensions of pre-service teachers' memories and identities; 2) help pre-service teachers access and articulate their tacit expectations about teaching; 3) address the image of the teacher as role model; and 4) attend to the political aspects of a prospective teacher's convictions. © 2014 .},

abstract={In this article, we explore the reality of Icelandic preschool teachers who are, as in most other countries, predominantly female. The gendered nature of the role and the current identity adopted by preschool teachers appear to impact on their perceived status and professionalism. In this process, stakeholders in early childhood education (ECE), as well as the preschool teachers themselves, play important parts. The question that underlies the paper is: ‘How do the views of preschool teachers and stakeholders in ECE affect the preschool teachers’ professional identity?' The data used to answer the question are from focus group research carried out with preschool teachers and stakeholders in ECE in one community in Iceland. These stakeholders, besides preschool teachers and staff within the preschools, were parents, professionals at the municipal preschool office and politicians. The theoretical perspective informing the methodology of the research was ‘symbolic interactionism’ and the concept of ‘democratic professionalism’ was used as an aspirational framework to analyse the data. The findings reveal connections between the ideology relating to the preschool teachers’ educational role, their limited leadership and the gendered views of stakeholders. At the end of the paper, implications and recommendations for preschool teachers are suggested. © 2014 TACTYC.},

abstract={The Arts are acknowledged for their potential in providing learners with multiple ‘languages’ with which they might make their learning visible across all levels of education. This chapter explores how the integration of the Arts and education for sustainability can provide expanded opportunities for seeing, understanding and responding to the sustainability imperative. Such approaches encourage broad engagement and expression of ideas about sustainability that extend beyond more common approaches that have mostly responded to sustainability through the languages of the Sciences and geography. Traditionally, the Arts have been valued highly by the early childhood education field and typically lie at the heart of early childhood programs. Increasing engagement with the sustainability agenda in early childhood contexts suggests that teachers might find ways to integrate early education for sustainability with the Arts in meaningful ways. This chapter explores how an integrated Arts and Humanities subject in an early childhood teacher education course in Queensland, Australia provides a context for the integration of sustainability as a cross-curricular thread in teacher education, reflecting recent national curriculum innovation in Australia. © 2014 J.
