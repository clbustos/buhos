abstract={Inclusion and diversity are highly visible priorities at many colleges and universities. Efforts to diversify the professoriate have necessitated a better understanding of career outcomes for current female faculty and faculty of color. We measure risk of leaving without tenure and years to promotion from associate to full professor at four large land grant universities. We model career outcomes as competing risks, and compute cumulative incidence functions to discern differences in tenure and promotion outcomes by gender and race. We find incidence rates vary significantly by academic discipline, and in many instances, show larger effects than gender and racial or ethnic differences. Our examination also indicates that in particular academic fields, females are more prone to leave without tenure, and less likely to be promoted to full professor. We also find that racial or ethnic minorities are less likely to be promoted to full professor in certain areas. The analysis suggests that for universities to address systemic issues of underrepresentation in academe, they must account for department level contexts, and align institutional practices to support the goal of inclusion and diversity. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Although research shows higher levels of perceived academic control are associated with academic adjustment in the first year of university, little is known about how changes in perceived control over multiple years relate to longitudinal university dropout and grades. Thus, our 3-year study (N = 1,007) examined whether changes in perceived control predicted university dropout and whether this relationship was mediated by university grade point average (GPA). Latent change score models showed that although first-year perceived control declined on average, there were high levels of variability between students, so that perceptions of control increased for some students. Discrete time survival analysis models showed that such positive changes in perceived control were associated with reduced dropout rates. Increases in perceived control also predicted higher subsequent university grades. Finally, we confirmed that the relationship between perceived control and dropout was mediated by university grades. Findings advance the literature in highlighting longitudinal linkages between perceived academic control and university grades and their influence on subsequent dropout. Implications for instructors and institutions to support adequate control perceptions, especially in the first academic year, are discussed. © 2019 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={We conduct a survival analysis for the viewing durations of massive open online courses. The hazard function of the empirical duration data presents as a bathtub curve with the Lindy effect in its tail. To understand the evolutionary mechanisms underlying these features, we categorize learners into two classes based on their different distributions of viewing durations, namely lognormal distribution and power law with exponential cutoff. Two random differential equations are provided to describe the growth patterns of viewing durations for the two classes respectively. The expected duration change rate of the learners featured by lognormal distribution is supposed to be dependent on their past duration, and that of the remainder of learners is supposed to be inversely proportional to time. Solutions to the equations predict the features of viewing duration distributions, and those of the hazard function. The equations also reveal the features of memory and memorylessness for the respective viewing behaviors of the two classes. © 1996-2012 Tsinghua University Press.},

funding_text 1={In the presented equations, the viewing durations are based on random factors and memory or memorylessness. When they begin studying a course, a learner does not need to have knowledge of the course. As they study more deeply, however, the learner needs the knowledge from earlier in the course in order to proceed comfortably. This process could be regarded as the transition from memorylessness to memory. Meanwhile, the viewing duration distribution of each empirical course has a fat tail, known as a feature of complexity. We find that each tail is dominated by the tail of a lognormal distribution, and that viewing with memory can generate a lognormal distribution. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms underlying the transition contributes to an understanding of the role of memory in the complexity of learning behaviors.

abstract={Despite the absence of formal entry barriers, Italy is lagging behind the majority of the developed countries in the share of young individuals with tertiary education. Exploiting the administrative data of a large public Italian institution, we analyze student academic careers across recent matriculation cohorts. We propose a flexible discrete-time competing risks estimation that allows overcoming some major limitations of conventional competing risks models. We find that student pathways vary tremendously across prior schooling profiles: for example, the within 4-year dropout probability ranges between 10% and 77%. We observe improvements over time in retention and time-to-degree, and by decomposing changes into components related to the composition of the enrolled population, the choice of the field of study and ‘individual behavior’ after enrolment, we find that the latter plays a major role. However, the improvement is limited in size and does not interest students from the vocational track. Since this progress is not accompanied by an increase in the share of students making the transition from high school to university, altogether our results call for great concern over the inclusiveness and effectiveness of the Italian university system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Following the introduction of performance management in Italian universities, Business intelligence has become a strategical means to use administrative data in support of governance and decision-making processes. The aim of this paper is to show the important role played by a decision support system inside an organization by evaluating the outcomes of the fair tuition fee policy of the University of Bari, in favour of low-income students, stated as a priority in its mission. A longitudinal analysis is carried out on the cohort of first-year students enrolled in the academic year 2015–2016, searching for a predictive model of their performance given some explicative variables. The usefulness of adopting a periodic monitoring system, investigating data by means of suitable statistical techniques (logistic regression, survival analysis, Cox regression model), allows to early detect those factors to be modified in order to achieve optimal results with respect to student expectations and quality of higher education. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={This paper examines gender differences according to two new indicators in higher education studies. One indicator represents the length of studies beyond the minimum requirement and the other represents a harmonised graduation mark. We explore these indicators in a statistical framework that consists of Survival analysis Kaplan–Meier methods, Accelerated Failure Time models, Survival Trees, Multivariate Regression Trees and a modified Gender Parity Index. This unique combination of statistical methods allows both to analyse data involving censoring and to incorporate other explanatory variables in the analysis. The approaches were applied to data taken from a Greek and an Italian University and provide evidence that the survival analysis is a useful tool for exploring gender gaps in higher education while the Accelerated Failure Time model permits the investigation of how other variables can influence the gaps. The data mining techniques of survival trees and multivariate regression trees allows for the importance of such influencing variables to be measured and illustrates these in a simple to view tree structure. The Multivariate Regression Tree approach allows us to consider more than one continuous outcome variable so we were able to consider the two proposed indicators simultaneously. Interesting insights from this analysis are that gender has an important role and women outperform regarding these new indicators by taking less length of studies, less graduation time with higher performance, controlling also for other student characteristics. The modified gender parity index enriched the results in all stages. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Wright D, Tan MY, O'Gorman N, et al. Predictive performance of the competing risk model in screening for preeclampsia. Am J Obstet Gynecol 2019;220:199.e1-13. In an original research article published in the February 2019 issue of the Journal, the full name of a 2016 National Health Service cohort study conducted in 7 maternity hospitals in England was spelled out incorrectly. The correct name of the study, abbreviated “SPREE,” is Screening Program for Preeclampsia, not, as published, Superior Province Rifting EarthScope Experiment. The incorrect full name of the study appears once in the text (column 3, page 199.e2) and is repeated in column headings, section identification, keys, and/or labels in Tables 1 and 2 (pages 199.e3 and 199.e4), Figure 1 (page 199.e5), and online-only Supplemental Figures 1, 2, and 3 (pages 199.e10, 199.e11, and 199.e12). The abbreviation is used as a label in graphs, but is not spelled out, in Figure 2 and in online-only Supplemental Figures 4, 5, and 6. In addition, 2 items under “Author and article information” (page 199.e9) require amplification. First, to the published academic affiliation of the fourth-named author, Liona C. Poon, MD, the following should be appended: “Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, People's Republic of China.” Second, a full description of support for the study reads as follows: “This study was supported by grants from the National Institute for Health Research Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (NIHR EME) Program (14/01/02), an MRC–NIHR partnership; the Fetal Medicine Foundation (UK Charity No. 1037116); and NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care South London at King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. The views expressed are the authors’ and do not necessarily reflect those of the MRC, NHS, NIHR, or Department of Health. “Reagents and equipment for the measurement of serum placental growth factor were provided gratis by PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences and Thermo Fisher Scientific, both in Waltham, MA, which were not involved in the study design; the collection, analysis, or interpretation of data; the writing of the report; or the decision to submit the article for publication.” © 2019},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to use survival analysis method to discuss the factors that affect student attendance duration. In this study, 182 dropouts, most of the suspension of the school occurred in the freshman year. We analysis the student backgrounds of suspension of study, such as their 'college', 'school loan', ' type of higher school ', 'indigenous peoples', those reasons are more than 20%. Use Kaplan-Meier curve, we find that the attendance duration will be significantly different by the different background factors, such as 'college', 'school loan', 'early alert', and 'half of the credits failed'. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Objective: To determine whether completing a pre-enrollment Web-based alcohol brief motivational intervention (BMI) increased student retention and reduced student alcohol-related violations. Participants: Fall 2011 (3,364) and Fall 2012 (3,111) entering cohorts of all first-year students at a midwestern state university. Method: Students completing the brief intervention (BI) were compared to students not completing the BI. Retention was tracked for four years for the 2011 cohort and three years for the 2012 cohort. Campus and community alcohol violations were tracked for two academic years following enrollment. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were used to test retention survival. Logistic regression was used to test campus and community violations. Results: Students in both cohorts who completed the BI had significantly higher retention and significantly fewer alcohol-related violations than noncompleters. Conclusions: Population-level Web-based BIs help prevent student dropout and decrease alcohol-related violations, with impacts extending multiple years. Web-based BI is an efficacious population-level prevention tool. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The shortage of professionals in the field of natural sciences and engineering is a problem that reaches many countries. In Brazil, one of the reasons for this is the significant dropout rates that the courses of the field in the tertiary education present. Since the courses of public institutions and the financial support offered to students from private institutions are paid with governmental resources, it is important to evaluate the reasons that lead to abandon. Thus, this article seeks to analyze the dropout rates of these courses, studying covariates that influence on this decision. The method employed is the Survival Analysis, and the dataset used is the Tertiary Education Survey from 2009 to 2014. As results, it is found that the dropout rates are higher in private colleges. Men and older students present a negative time ratio, but the indexes are positive if the student receives financial support. © 2019, Instituto de Pesquisas Economicas da FEA-USP.

abstract={Mathematics is viewed as essential to the economic competitiveness of the United States on the global stage (US Department of Education). As a part of the core Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, mathematics is vital to the nation's economic prosperity, yet enrollment in STEM fields at the college/university level has remained relatively stable, despite millions of dollars expended to improve STEM education and retention. Most extant research focuses on innovations within classroom settings that can improve learning outcomes for students pursuing STEM majors. Additional research is needed in examining how the sequencing of courses taken by students can help or hinder their progress toward the successful completion of a STEM degree. In this first phase of our research, quantitative analytics was used to identify the impact of specific courses on students’ risk of dropping out of a Math major. Findings suggest a general inverse correlation between academic performance and attrition: good performance predicts lower attrition rates. Survival analysis indicated that the further a student goes within the math major, the greater the risk of dropping out. Students in a Math major tend to be more likely to drop out after their 4th year compared to their first three years. In general, students show increased inclination to switch majors from their second year and those students who have stayed in the program for too long are very likely to switch to another major. © 2017},

abstract={Several studies indicate the benefit of mapping gamification elements to personality. However, this mapping requires a strong understanding of the relationship between gamification elements and personality. The existing research that has tried to address this relationship is based on a self-report questionnaire that is obtained from only those learners who complete the entire study. Unfortunately, a bias may result from first forcing learners to complete an entire study and then ignoring learners who drop out in the middle of a study. To overcome this bias, we use a more objective approach to understand the relationship between personality and gamification. In our study, we use the dropout rate as a proxy for learner motivation. We hypothesize that learners who are more motivated by gamification elements will use the gamified website longer. Furthermore, because we use a different method than previous studies used, we analyse our data differently. Our solution is to use survival analysis to analyse our data, which confirms the benefit of using gamification to enhance learner motivation. Our results point to the relationship between the response of different personalities and gamification elements. In further studies, we recommend to use this same approach but with more gamification elements. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Gamification plays an important role in enhancing learners' motivation and engagement. Different personalities respond differently to gamification elements. The dropout rate can be used to measure learners' motivation. Enhancing the motivation of learners does not necessarily improve their learning. © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={In this study, we seek to contribute to the literature on traditional charter school (TCS) closure by examining the potential relationships among racial and socioeconomic enrollment characteristics, TCS age and early adopter status, student achievement and the likelihood of closure within Ohio’s “Big 8” Urban Counties (OBEUC). Using life tables and binary logistic regression, we examined 3,204 TCS school years (424 TCS) in OBEUC from the arrival of TCS in 1998 through 2015 to assess these relationships. While the Ohio Department of Education (ODE) reports that poor academic performance is the second most cited reason for TCS closure, we find no evidence that student performance predicts TCS closure in OBEUC. However, we find that compared to TCS with integrated enrollments, TCS with predominantly White or Black enrollments face higher risks of closure in OBEUC, even when controlling for other factors. This lack of a connection between student performance and TCS closure calls into question the argument that TCS closure is evidence that the accountability function of school choice policy is working. © 2019, Arizona State University.

abstract={Higher education institutions are increasingly seeking technological solutions to not only enhance the learning environment but also support students. In this study, we explored the case of an early alert system (EAS) at a regional university engaged in both on-campus and online teaching. Using a total of 16,142 observations captured between 2011 and 2013, we examined the relationship between EAS and the student retention rate. The results indicate that when controlling for demographic, institution, student performance and workload variables, the EAS is able to identify students who have a significantly higher risk of discontinuing from their studies. This implies that early intervention strategies are effective in addressing student retention, and thus an EAS is able to provide actionable information to the student support team. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Resilience represents the ability of systems and individuals to adapt and overcome the difficulties and challenges they face. Resilient entrepreneurs are those who cope with stressful or adverse situations by relying on both internal and external factors. This article examines the way higher education graduates express entrepreneurial resilience in various national contexts. We analyze the Research into Employment and professional Flexibility (REFLEX) data set that provides information on early career of higher education graduates leaving education in the academic year 1999/2000 in 13 European countries. We study resilience in entrepreneurship by considering both how long higher education graduates succeed to remain in self-employment and the extent to which they re-entry in entrepreneurship after exiting. Survival analyses, logistic and cox regressions indicate important differences in patterns of starting, remaining and returning in self-employment and in factors influencing the retention in entrepreneurship among higher education graduates. It is argued that structural factors, personal characteristics and educational background explain a large amount of variation in resilient entrepreneurship. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Prior research examining whether depression and anxiety lead to high-school dropout has been limited by a reliance on retrospective reports, the assessment of mental health at a single point in time (often remote from the time of high-school exit), and the omission of important measures of the social and familial environment. The present study addressed these limitations by analyzing 8 waves of longitudinal data from a cohort of Australian adolescents (n = 1,057) in the Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey (2001-2008). Respondents were followed from the age of 15 years through completion of or exit from high school. Discrete-time survival analysis was used to assess whether the early experience of a distress disorder (indicated by scores <50 on the 5-item Mental Health Inventory from the Short Form Health Survey) predicted subsequent high-school dropout, after controlling for household and parental socioeconomic characteristics and for tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. Adolescents with a prior distress disorder had twice the odds of high-school dropout compared with those without (odds ratio = 1.99, 95% confidence interval: 1.24, 3.17). This association was somewhat attenuated but remained significant in models including tobacco and alcohol consumption (odds ratio = 1.74, 95% confidence interval: 1.74; 1.09, 2.78). These results suggest that improving the mental health of high-school students may promote better educational outcomes. © The Author(s) 2018.

abstract={Studies of psychological distress (PD) in university students have shown that they have high prevalence rates. These findings have raised concerns that PD may be leading to poorer student outcomes, such as elevated dropout rates. The aim of this study was to examine the association of PD in undergraduate university students with the competing risks of degree dropout or completion. It analysed data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey. The sample comprised 1265 university students. PD (i.e., probable depression and/or anxiety) was measured with a validated cut-off score of ≤65 on the 5-item Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) from the Short Form 36 (SF-36). The study used an accelerated longitudinal design with student year of study as the metric of time and estimated dynamic discrete-time, competing risks survival models. Contrary to expectations, the study found that students with PD had lower odds of degree dropout and higher odds of degree completion than students without PD in year 4 of their degrees. This study contributes to the empirical literature on university student mental health by showing that, while PD can be debilitating and negatively affect students’ general educational experience, it is not as harmful to academic progress as might be assumed. © 2017 HERDSA.},

abstract={Background: The first year of life is an important window to initiate healthy infant feeding practices to promote healthy growth. Interventions delivered by mobile phone (mHealth) provide a novel approach for reaching parents; however, little is known about the effectiveness of mHealth for child obesity prevention. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an mHealth obesity prevention intervention in terms of reach, acceptability, and impact on key infant feeding outcomes. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted with an mHealth intervention group (Growing healthy) and a nonrandomized comparison group (Baby’s First Food). The intervention group received access to a free app and website containing information on infant feeding, sleep and settling, and general support for parents with infants aged 0 to 9 months. App-generated notifications directed parents to age-and feeding-specific content within the app. Both groups completed Web-based surveys when infants were less than 3 months old (T1), at 6 months of age (T2), and 9 months of age (T3). Survival analysis was used to examine the duration of any breastfeeding and formula introduction, and cox proportional hazard regression was performed to examine the hazard ratio for ceasing breast feeding between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for a range of child and parental factors was used to compare the exclusive breastfeeding, formula feeding behaviors, and timing of solid introduction between the 2 groups. Mixed effect polynomial regression models were performed to examine the group differences in growth trajectory from birth to T3. Results: A total of 909 parents initiated the enrollment process, and a final sample of 645 parents (Growing healthy=301, Baby’s First Food=344) met the eligibility criteria. Most mothers were Australian born and just under half had completed a university education. Retention of participants was high (80.3%, 518/645) in both groups. Most parents (226/260, 86.9%) downloaded and used the app; however, usage declined over time. There was a high level of satisfaction with the program, with 86.1% (143/166) reporting that they trusted the information in the app and 84.6% (170/201) claiming that they would recommend it to a friend. However, some technical problems were encountered with just over a quarter of parents reporting that the app failed to work at times. There were no significant differences between groups in any of the target behaviors. Growth trajectories also did not differ between the 2 groups. Conclusions: An mHealth intervention using a smartphone app to promote healthy infant feeding behaviors is a feasible and acceptable mode for delivering obesity prevention intervention to parents; however, app usage declined over time. Learnings from this study will be used to further enhance the program so as to improve its potential for changing infant feeding behaviors. © Rachel A Laws, Elizabeth A Denney-Wilson, Sarah Taki, Catherine G Russell, Miaobing Zheng, Eloise-Kate Litterbach,Kok-Leong Ong, Sharyn J Lymer, Rosalind Elliott, Karen J Campbell.},

funding_text 1={The findings of this study support mHealth as an acceptable mode of delivery for obesity prevention interventions in infancy, particularly those targeting infant feeding, with high rates of recruitment [42] and a retention rate of 80% at 9 months follow-up. It is important to acknowledge that the high retention rates might reflect, in part, the payment offered for survey completion and the use of 3 reminders. Acceptability of the program is supported by the high rates of reported user satisfaction with the program. This is consistent with findings from our qualitative follow-up interviews with parents [43] where they reported engagement with the program was promoted by the credibility of the program source, the user-friendly interface, and tailoring of content and push notifications to the baby’s age and key transition points. Our findings are congruent with existing research, which suggests that parents are increasingly relying on online source of information for infant feeding and care [23-27].},

abstract={Background: The first year of life is an important window to initiate healthy infant feeding practices to promote healthy growth. Interventions delivered by mobile phone (mHealth) provide a novel approach for reaching parents; however, little is known about the effectiveness of mHealth for child obesity prevention. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an mHealth obesity prevention intervention in terms of reach, acceptability, and impact on key infant feeding outcomes. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted with an mHealth intervention group (Growing healthy) and a nonrandomized comparison group (Baby's First Food). The intervention group received access to a free app and website containing information on infant feeding, sleep and settling, and general support for parents with infants aged 0 to 9 months. App-generated notifications directed parents to age-and feeding-specific content within the app. Both groups completed Web-based surveys when infants were less than 3 months old (T1), at 6 months of age (T2), and 9 months of age (T3). Survival analysis was used to examine the duration of any breastfeeding and formula introduction, and cox proportional hazard regression was performed to examine the hazard ratio for ceasing breast feeding between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for a range of child and parental factors was used to compare the exclusive breastfeeding, formula feeding behaviors, and timing of solid introduction between the 2 groups. Mixed effect polynomial regression models were performed to examine the group differences in growth trajectory from birth to T3. Results: A total of 909 parents initiated the enrollment process, and a final sample of 645 parents (Growing healthy=301, Baby's First Food=344) met the eligibility criteria. Most mothers were Australian born and just under half had completed a university education. Retention of participants was high (80.3%, 518/645) in both groups. Most parents (226/260, 86.9%) downloaded and used the app; however, usage declined over time. There was a high level of satisfaction with the program, with 86.1% (143/166) reporting that they trusted the information in the app and 84.6% (170/201) claiming that they would recommend it to a friend. However, some technical problems were encountered with just over a quarter of parents reporting that the app failed to work at times. There were no significant differences between groups in any of the target behaviors. Growth trajectories also did not differ between the 2 groups. Conclusions: An mHealth intervention using a smartphone app to promote healthy infant feeding behaviors is a feasible and acceptable mode for delivering obesity prevention intervention to parents; however, app usage declined over time. Learnings from this study will be used to further enhance the program so as to improve its potential for changing infant feeding behaviors. © Rachel A Laws, Elizabeth A Denney-Wilson, Sarah Taki, Catherine G Russell, Miaobing Zheng, Eloise-Kate Litterbach, Kok-Leong Ong, Sharyn J Lymer, Rosalind Elliott, Karen J Campbell.},

funding_text 1={The findings of this study support mHealth as an acceptable mode of delivery for obesity prevention interventions in infancy, particularly those targeting infant feeding, with high rates of recruitment [42] and a retention rate of 80% at 9 months follow-up. It is important to acknowledge that the high retention rates might reflect, in part, the payment offered for survey completion and the use of 3 reminders. Acceptability of the program is supported by the high rates of reported user satisfaction with the program. This is consistent with findings from our qualitative follow-up interviews with parents [43] where they reported engagement with the program was promoted by the credibility of the program source, the user-friendly interface, and tailoring of content and push notifications to the baby’s age and key transition points. Our findings are congruent with existing research, which suggests that parents are increasingly relying on online source of information for infant feeding and care [23-27].},

abstract={Higher education institutions in the United States and across the Western world face a critical problem of attrition of college students and this problem is particularly acute within the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Students are especially vulnerable in the initial years of their academic programs; more than 60% of the dropouts occur in the first two years. Therefore, early identification of at-risk students is crucial for a focused intervention if institutions are to support students towards completion. In this paper we developed and evaluated a survival analysis framework for the early identification of students at the risk of dropping out. We compared the performance of survival analysis approaches to other machine learning approaches including logistic regression, decision trees and boosting. The proposed methods show good performance for early prediction of at-risk students and are also able to predict when a student will dropout with high accuracy. We performed a comparative analysis of nine different majors with varying levels of academic rigor, challenge and student body. This study enables advisors and university administrators to intervene in advance to improve student retention. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to verify if adult education can contribute to social mobility by analysing how the socioeconomic and professional background of the students affects dropout and graduation hazards in higher education. Design/methodology/approach: An event history analysis approach, with competing risks and discrete time, implemented under a multinomial logit model, is used to investigate how an extensive set of covariates affects the risk of graduation, dropout and persistence of 834 adult student workers from a higher education institution in Portugal. Findings: Adult education may indeed be effective in promoting social mobility, as academic achievement is higher for student workers that have low educated parents and low income levels. Also, the probability of achieving graduation seems to be higher for those seeking for higher transformation. Practical implications: Adult education should be encouraged as it generates both efficiency and equity benefits. Some policy recommendations are suggested for the higher education system to adapt better to the particular characteristics of adult workers and provide conditions to improve the job–study–family conciliation, namely, by adjusting the schedule and composition of classes, appreciating the curriculum and providing orientation to candidates, and introducing shorter/simplified versions of the degrees. Originality/value: A separate treatment is given to adult student workers, whose characteristics are very particular, enriching the literature on academic achievement that has been focussed on traditional students. Additionally, the studied data set merges five sources and provides extensive and original information on personal, degree and employment variables of the students. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Background: Despite the highly selective admission processes utilised by medical schools, a significant cohort of medical students still face academic difficulties and are at a higher risk of delayed graduation or outright dismissal. Methods: This study used survival analysis to identify the non-academic and academic risk factors (and their relative risks) associated with academic difficulty at a regionally located medical school. Retrospective non-academic and academic entry data for all medical students who were enrolled at the time of the study (2009-2014) were collated and analysed. Non-academic variables included age at commencement of studies, gender, Indigenous status, origin, first in family to go to University (FIF), non-English speaking background (NESB), socio-economic status (SES) and rurality expressed as Australian Standard Geographical Classification-Remoteness Area (ASGC-RA). Academic variables included tertiary entrance exam score expressed as overall position (OP) and interview score. In addition, post-entry mid- and end-of-year summative assessment data in the first and second years of study were collated. Results: The results of the survival analysis indicated that FIF, Indigenous and very remote backgrounds, as well as low post-entry Year 1 (final) and Year 2 (mid-year and final) examination scores were strong risk factors associated with academic difficulty. A high proportion of the FIF students who experienced academic difficulty eventually failed and exited the medical program. Further exploratory research will be required to identify the specific needs of this group of students in order to develop appropriate and targeted academic support programs for them. Conclusions: This study has highlighted the need for medical schools to be proactive in establishing support interventions/strategies earlier rather than later, for students experiencing academic difficulty because, the earlier such students can be flagged, the more likely they are able to obtain positive academic outcomes. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={University spin-offs (USOs) are considered as a means of value creation derived from academic research. However, due to financial and managerial constraints, many USOs find it difficult to maintain their business and achieve stabilization. In this study, we investigate the factors affecting the time taken by USOs to reach their break-even point or to secure initial investment from venture capitals, whichever comes earlier. We specifically examine the effect of knowledge diversity, experiential knowledge, intellectual property, and the communication capacity of the USO founders on the time taken to reach stabilization. A competing risk model is applied to the survey data of USO founders in Korea. According to our findings, knowledge diversity, experiential knowledge, and communication capacity are significantly related to the time taken to reach the break-even point. Knowledge diversity, intellectual property, and communication capacity, on the other hand, are associated with the time taken to receive initial investment from venture capitals. Our study can contribute toward deriving strategies for USOs to increase their stabilization speed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Background: Until recently, there were only a few medical schools in Ethiopia. However, currently, in response to the apparent shortage in physician workforce, the country has made huge progress with respect to the expansion of medical schools, by adopting the so-called flooding strategy. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the intended strategy also relies on physician accessibility and turnover. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the distribution of physicians in the medical schools of Ethiopia and to quantify the magnitude and identify factors associated with physician turnover. Methods: This organizational faculty physician workforce survey was conducted in seven government-owned medical schools in Ethiopia. Longitudinal medical workforce data set of about 6 years (between September 2009 and June 2015) were retrospectively collected from each of the medical schools. The observation time begins with the date of employment (time zero) and ends at the date on which the physician leaves the appointment/or the data collection date. Kaplan-Meier survival method was used to describe the duration of stay of physicians in the academic health care settings. A Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model was fitted to identify the risk factors for physician turnover. Results: In this study, a total of 1258 faculty physicians were observed in seven medical schools which resulted in 6670.5 physician-years. Of the total, there were 198 (15.7%) turnover events and the remaining 1060 (84.3%) were censored. The average turnover rate is about 29.7 per 1000 physician-years of observations. Multivariate modeling revealed no statistical significant difference in the rate of turnover between males and females (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR), 1.12; 95%CI, 0.71, 1.80). However, a lower rate of physician turnover was observed among those who were born before 1975 (AHR, 0.37; 95%CI, 0.20, 0.69) compared with those who were born after 1985. Physicians with the academic rank of associate professor and above had a lower (AHR, 0.25; 95%CI, 0.11, 0.60) rate of turnover in comparison to lecturers. In addition, physicians working in Jimma University had 1.66 times higher rate of turnover compared with those working in Addis Ababa University. However, the model showed a significantly lower rate of turnover in Mekelle (AHR, 0.16; 95%CI, 0.06, 0.41) and University of Gondar (AHR, 0.46; 95%CI, 0.25, 0.84) compared with that of Addis Ababa. Physician turnover in the remaining medical schools (Bahir Dar, Haromaya, and Hawassa) did not show a statistically significant difference with Addis Ababa University (P > 0.05). Conclusions: This study revealed a strong association between physician turnover with age, academic rank, and workplace. Therefore, the findings of the study have important implications in that attention needs to be given for the needs of faculty physicians and for improving the work environment in order to achieve a high level of retention. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Dropouts and delayed graduations are critical issues in higher education systems world wide. A key task in this context is to identify risk factors associated with these events, providing potential targets for mitigating policies. For this, we employ a discrete time competing risks survival model, dealing simultaneously with university outcomes and its associated temporal component. We define survival times as the duration of the student's enrolment at university and possible outcomes as graduation or two types of dropout (voluntary and involuntary), exploring the information recorded at admission time (e.g. educational level of the parents) as potential predictors. Although similar strategies have been previously implemented, we extend the previous methods by handling covariate selection within a Bayesian variable selection framework, where model uncertainty is formally addressed through Bayesian model averaging. Our methodology is general; however, here we focus on undergraduate students enrolled in three selected degree programmes of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile during the period 2000–2011. Our analysis reveals interesting insights, highlighting the main covariates that influence students’ risk of dropout and delayed graduation. © 2016 Royal Statistical Society},

abstract={Introduction: This study analysed the internal and external factors related to the reflection abilities of dental trainees. Participants and methods: We created transcripts from oral presentations by the dental trainees of Hiroshima University Hospital (n = 35, 2012–2013) at a significant event analysis conference. The reflection depths were compared between the trainees of the university hospital and external clinical combination groups. We determined and statistically analysed the reflection depths. Results: At the end of training, a Mann–Whitney U-test revealed a significant difference in the median reflection depths of the groups (U = 66, W = 342 and P = 0.007). The results of multiple regression analysis indicated a significant relation between the reflection depth and external training completion (P = 0.024). There were no relations with other factors, including gender and academic background. Conclusion: Experiences in external clinics create a close connection between the staff and trainees because communities of practice can cause deeper reflections. We need to create small groups in large-scale organisations such as university hospitals. This construct can be adapted not only for Japanese dental trainees but also for global dental and other medical trainees. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={The aim of this study is to identify the factors that influence student-teachers drop-out rates, taking their individual and academic characteristics into account. The study was conducted on 531 student-teachers from the 2009 cohort. This is a quantitative and non experimental study of a longitudinal nature and an explanatory research design. To collect the data a secondary data analysis was used and the data were later analysed by the survival analysis method and modelled by the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The findings show that the individuals variables that explain student-teachers' drop-out rates correspond to the gender and place of origin (Bío-Bío región). On the other hand, the academics variables that explain student-teachers' drop-out rates correspond to the secondary education grade point average, place in the list of selected, secondary education with a scientific and humanities oriented curriculum, total signed up courses, latest academic grade point average and withdrawal from university. It is concluded that the abilities associated with the level of achievement of academic results and social support for students, management constitute important aspects to keep the commitment to stay in school academic program. To the extent that management skills and support are positive, students will have favorable interactions that will support their participation at the institutional level, which promote intellectual and academic development. Finally, it is concluded that the level of institutional policy is relevant to manage the support of the abilities and the adaptation of students as they will contribute in creating a positive balance between academic and social integration, from the configuration of elements they support the development of a context of motivation which will maintain the commitment of students achieving the goal of graduation. © 2017, Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

abstract={Retention of students at colleges and universities has been a concern among educators for many decades. The consequences of student attrition are significant for students, academic staffs and the universities. Thus, increasing student retention is a long term goal of any academic institution. The most vulnerable students are the freshman, who are at the highest risk of dropping out at the beginning of their study. Therefore, the early identification of "at-risk" students is a crucial task that needs to be effectively addressed. In this paper, we develop a survival analysis framework for early prediction of student dropout using Cox proportional hazards model (Cox). We also applied time-dependent Cox (TD-Cox), which captures time-varying factors and can leverage those information to provide more accurate prediction of student dropout. Our model utilizes different groups of variables such as demographic, family background, financial, high school information, college enrollment and semester-wise credits. The proposed framework has the ability to address the challenge of predicting dropout students as well as the semester that the dropout will occur. This study enables us to perform proactive interventions in a prioritized manner where limited academic resources are available. This is critical in the student retention problem because not only correctly classifying whether a student is going to dropout is important but also when this is going to happen is crucial for a focused intervention. We evaluate our method on real student data collected at Wayne State University. Results show that the proposed Cox-based framework can predict the student dropouts and semester of dropout with high accuracy and precision compared to the other state-of-the-art methods. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={The effect of credit constraints on university outcomes is studied. Credit constraints have a negative relationship with dropout, especially on lower achieving high school graduates. Credit constrained students with strong high school achievement are 13-15% more (less) likely to graduate (be slow finishers) relative to otherwise similar students who are potentially or unlikely constrained. Using competing risk analysis, we find dropout is most likely in the first year of study and falls over time for all students. After 3 years of study, the risk of dropout increases for students who are constrained suggesting constraints may eventually bind on these students. © 2015 The Department of Economics, University of Oxford and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Difficulty Initiating Sleep is a prevalent disorder in university students. In this study, we aimed to estimate the time of going to bed to get sleep and to identify its determinants by survival analysis. This study is based on a cross-sectional study that was been performed on 277 students who lived in dormitories of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS). We used Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI), General Health Questionnaire(GHQ) and a demographic questionnaire for data collection. Independent t-test, One-way ANOVA and survival analysis were used for analyzing the data. Mean ± SD of time of going to bed to get sleep was 23.61±16.31 minutes. Range of this time was between 0 to 90 minutes. This time was related to sleep quality, mental health and tea drinking in univariate analysis. Cox regression model showed sleep quality, working alongside academic affairs, financial source type for living expences and effect modification between two last variables were significant determinants of sleep latency. All determinants of sleep latency in our study are changeable factors. It means educationonal programs can play a very important role in controlling of these factors and improvement of sleep status of dormitory students.},

abstract={Survival analysis - specifically the actuarial life-table method and the Cox Proportional Hazards model - was used to assess Bronfenbrenner's bio-ecological model with regards to the onset of sexual intercourse in a random sample of 1697 grade 9 and grade 11 pupils in the North West Province of South Africa. Data were collected in July and August 2007. Of the contextual factors examined, only academic performance and community disorganization were found to be statistically significantly associated with age at first sexual intercourse amongst girls. High academic performance by girls is positively associated with age at first sexual intercourse, while girls who live in disorganized communities initiate sexual intercourse earlier than their counterparts in other communities. Age is negatively associated with the timing of first sexual debut among both girls and boys. Males initiate sexual intercourse earlier than females, while youths with at least one sexual partner are much more likely to initiate sexual intercourse earlier than those without sexual partners.

abstract={Background: Recruitment and retention of talent is central to the research performance of universities. Existing research shows that, while men are more likely than women to be promoted at the different stages of the academic career, no such difference is found when it comes to faculty retention rates. Current research on faculty retention, however, focuses on careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). We extend this line of inquiry to the social sciences. Methods: We follow 2,218 tenure-track assistant professors hired since 1990 in seven social science disciplines at nineteen U.S. universities from time of hire to time of departure. We also track their time to promotion to associate and full professor. Using survival analysis, we examine gender differences in time to departure and time to promotion. Our methods account for censoring and unobserved heterogeneity, as well as effect heterogeneity across disciplines and cohorts. Results: We find no statistically significant differences between genders in faculty retention. However, we do find that men are more likely to be granted tenure than women. When it comes to promotion to full professor, the results are less conclusive, as the effect of gender is sensitive to model specification. Conclusions: The results corroborate previous findings about gender patterns in faculty retention and promotion. They suggest that advances have been made when it comes to gender equality in retention and promotion, but important differences still persist. © 2015 Copyright Box-Steffensmeier et al.

abstract={Universities around the world are grappling with strategies to increase throughput and minimise dropout rates of postgraduate students. This study focuses on students at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and we attempt to estimate the time that it takes for these students to successfully complete or drop out from a master's programme. We used survival analysis to identify the factors which affect this. The results of this analysis showed that having some form of financial aid and/or being a student in the Faculties of Humanities or Management, all significantly shortened the length of time that it took to eventually drop out from a master's programme. For students who successfully completed a master's degree, having some form of financial aid, being of international origin and/or being registered in the Faculties of Health, Humanities, Law or Management, all helped to significantly shorten the length of time it took to successfully complete a master's programme. Students in the Faculty of Medicine, however, took longer to successfully complete their studies. Black Africans took less time to complete their master's degrees when compared with otherwise identical students from the other race groups. © 2015. The Author(s).},

abstract={The literature has suggested that students' progress at university is influenced by their personal characteristics; this article examines whether these factors act differently according to the study fields of degree courses in which students are enrolled. In particular, the factors influencing the various outcomes of the university programme (withdrawals, course changes, delays, completion of degrees) in three-year degree courses in a large Italian university are analysed from the perspective of study fields. The authors examined the records of over 32,000 students enrolling from academic years 2002/3 to 2005/6 in 84 first-cycle degree courses, grouped in four different fields of study. Analyses were conducted by considering the time dimension within the methodological approach of survival analysis, by means of individual longitudinal data from university administrative archives. A discrete-time method for competing risks event history analysis was applied to study the determinants of university outcomes in the various fields of study. © 2014 Society for Research into Higher Education.},

abstract={There are many possible reasons why students leave university prior to degree completion, and one of the more commonly cited is being employed while studying. This paper analyses the impact of employment status on dropout rates using survival analysis. It finds that employment status does have an impact on dropout rates; students who work full time alongside studying full time are less likely to complete their programme than students working short part-time or not working at all. However, it seems as if there is a threshold to how much students can work, as working more than 20 h a week (long part-time work) increase the risk of dropout as much as full-time work. Integrating employment status into the analysis does not change the effect of variables known to have an influence on dropout, such as grades, gender and social background, but it contributes to further explain who are at risk of dropout. This implies that models for dropout and retention must also take such external factors into account, not just consider what happens at university, as in model of student departure. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={University researchers are commonly subject to formal evaluation of their 'scientific productivity' as defined by measures linked to academic publication. Comparative less attention is typically given to the assessment of their involvement in patenting. When this is done, the established practice is further to evaluate productivity using simple patent counts. This article argues the relevance of using more sophisticated measures of patenting activity, as part of assessments of scientific productivity. Specifically, patent survival analysis is applied on a sample of patent applications originating from Sweden's largest medical university. This analysis finds that patent lifespan is correlated to patent, inventor, and assignee characteristics. These results indicate that patent survival analysis could offer a more information-dense representation of a university's invention efforts longitudinally and therefore, add a qualitative dimension to the evaluation of academic research. This has potential implications for how universities involved in patenting and commercialization undertake internal evaluations, and how governmental bodies and/or other third-party financiers and policymakers design external performance assessment criteria. The results also point to the potential of combining legal status data with insights from academic inventors and patent owners to support funding bodies and university managers in resource allocation and for benchmarking purposes. © The Author 2015.},

abstract={Korea’s nonprofit sector has undergone a sudden expansion in the last decade and its nonprofits experienced high employee turnover. This study is the first in Korean literature to examine workforce shifts in nonprofit organizations and explore influential factors that explain job changes from the nonprofit sector to other sectors. Using a three-wave panel data set of community college/university graduates, the Graduates Occupational Mobility Survey, we conducted a discrete-time survival analysis with the dependent variable of actual turnover. Our findings indicate that over half of employees left nonprofits within a year, and the majority found a new job in for-profit organizations. Different factors predicted turnover to for-profits, government agencies, and educational or research institutes. Age, wage level, employment type, and the size of nonprofit organizations explained employee shifts. Satisfaction with one’s overall job, job content, social reputation, and opportunities for career development were significant predictors. Implications for nonprofit organizations are discussed. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.},
