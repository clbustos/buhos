Abstract = {{Peer support, a cornerstone in recovery programs for mental illness and
   addiction, has not been widely applied to service programs for survivors
   of suicide. In 2004-2006 Canadian Mental Health Association Suicide
   Services in Calgary, Alberta, introduced the Peer Support Program for
   adults, an adjunct to conventional individual and group intervention.
   This article reports on a mixed-methods evaluation of the Peer Support
   Program. Hogan's Grief Response Checklist and the qualitative data
   tracked positive outcomes for both the peer supporters and the clients.
   This study challenges the unspoken assumption that survivors of suicide,
   due to their vulnerability, require the services of highly skilled
   professionals and would not be in a position to offer unsupervised
   support to peers. Rather it supports an intervention protocol that
   consists of peer supporters and professionals working collaboratively to
   offer cost-effective, client-centered services.}},
