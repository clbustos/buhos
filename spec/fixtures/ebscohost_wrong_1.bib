Abstract = {Israeli students and their families can choose between state-funded secular, religious, orthodox, and other alternative schools (e.g., Waldorf, Montessori, democratic). Earlier studies showed that the motivation to engage with science differs greatly between Israeli students in secular schools and democratic schools, with these differences being attributed to differences in school culture rather than home influence (Vedder-Weiss & Fortus, 2011, 2012). In this study we extend earlier studies by looking at religious state-funded schools that serve 18% of Israel’s Jewish population. These schools provide a unique research environment since from grade 6 they are gender-separated. We examined the science-related mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoid goal orientations, perceptions of the science teachers, parents, schools, and peers’ goal emphases in relation to science of the students in these schools. We compared between students in religious schools (newly collected data) and secular schools (data reported in prior studies), and found that there is a distinct difference between these two populations that is associated with differing attitudes toward gender and science at these schools. This study provides additional evidence for the influence of culture on students’ motivation to engage with science, suggests mechanisms by which this influence may occur.

Abstract = {Objectives: The presence of excessive mirror overflow in children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is discussed in numerous published reports. These reports, however, include a limited age range in their samples. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of diagnosis and sex on mirror overflow and standard deviation (SD) of tap time in children with and without ADHD across a larger age range (5–12 years) of children. Methods: One-hundred and forty-eight children with ADHD and 112 age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) children completed a finger sequencing task. Mirror overflow, SD of tap time, and mean tap time were measured using finger twitch transducers. Results: Results reveal a significant diagnostic effect on mirror overflow such that boys and girls with ADHD demonstrate increased overflow compared to same-sex TD children. Boys with ADHD demonstrated more variable tap times compared to TD boys; no diagnostic effect was observed in the girls. Conclusions: Boys with ADHD exhibit anomalous motor variability; girls with ADHD show similar levels of variability as TD girls. Boys and girls with ADHD exhibit similar levels of excessive mirror overflow. This lack of sex differences on mirror overflow is distinct from reports finding sex effects on overflow and could result from an examination of a broader age range than is included in prior reports. Adolescent data would provide a greater understanding of the trajectory of anomalous mirror overflow across development. Examination of functional and structural connectivity would expand the current understanding of the neurobiological foundation of motor overflow.

Abstract = {The academic underperformance of African American students, continues to limit their academic, career, and life opportunities. Consequently, many urban school districts have implemented single-sex instructional programs in an effort to better address the schooling needs of African Americans. This study's purpose was to evaluate to what extent the restructuring of a coeducation school to a single-sex school impacted reading achievement for African American students. Data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Data from the school years immediately prior to and the five years following the restructuring were compared to assess program effectiveness. For African American males, findings revealed mixed support for single-sex education. However, findings for African American females proved significant in favor of the single-sex school structure.

Abstract = {The present study was designed to examine how the attitudinal composition of class groups is related to the gender gap in language achievement at the end of secondary education. Data were drawn from the LOSO project and multilevel analyses were used. The results showed that the attitudes of the class groups, and, more specifically, the attitudes of same-sex classmates, had a stronger impact on the language achievement of boys than on the language achievement of girls. No gender differences were found in classes where students had good relationships with teachers, were motivated, and where students felt integrated, whereas boys performed less well than girls in classes where students did not have good relationship with teachers, were not very motivated, and felt poorly integrated.

Abstract = {Background: UK medical schools typically have over 300 students per year, making it impossible for students to know all the others well. Aims: This longitudinal cohort study measured the formation of medical student social networks and their relationship to grades. Method: In November 2009, 215/317 (68%) Year 2 UCL medical students reported their friendships with others in their year, by questionnaire. Multiple regression assessed the relationship between friendships, exam results and background variables (obtained from student records), with permutation testing to assess statistical significance. Results: Students of the same sex, the same ethnic group, and in the same tutor and small groups (to which they were randomly assigned at the start of medical school) were socially closer. Taking into account absolute difference in Year 1 grades, Year 2 pairs who were socially closer in November 2009 had more similar May 2010 grades. Individual student variables did not predict similarity in 2010 grades after taking friendships into account. Conclusions: The results suggest that medical students chose friends of the same sex and ethnic group as themselves; but random allocation of students to tutor groups also influenced friendships. Most importantly, friendships related to subsequent exam performance, suggesting friendship may influence learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Experiment 1 involved 154 9th- and 10th-grade grade girls attending a private, single-sex, high school; Experiment 2 involved a coeducational population of 100 9th-grade students in a public school. Best predictors in the 2 experiments were 8th-grade English grade and foreign language aptitude. Spelling was a significant predictor of Experiment 1 only. Principal components analyses of the test battery shoed 3 similar components: Phonology–Orthography, Meaning, and Foreign Language Aptitude–Metalinguistic. Regression analyses indicated that the 3 components contributed approximately 60% of the variance in foreign language grades. Findings are discussed in light of research on native language learning and its relationship to learning a foreign language. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Attempted to determine the effect of same-sex class organization on junior high school (7th and 8th grade) students' academic achievement, self-discipline, self-concept, sex role identification, and attitude toward school. A pre- and posttest experimental design with randomly assigned groups (with some adjustments in assignment) was employed. Each experimental group was in english, social studies, mathematics, science, and physical education classes for a full school year. The instructional content and method were essentially the same for both the control and experimental groups. 5 null hypotheses, one for each dependent variable, were tested by application of analysis of covariance using a 2  2  2 factorial design. While the data did not warrant the rejection of any of the null hypotheses, significant differences were found for factors not effected by the experimental treatment. Differences in academic achievement and general maturity were consistent with the research about early adolescence in that the differences favored the girls.

Abstract = {A number of studies report that from the first years of life, preterm children have more difficulty self-regulating and communicating in their social group. If these children show signs of difficulty adjusting socially, the question then is whether or not these problems continue and persist over time. The objective is to observe the combined effects of birth status and the passage of time on the resolution/persistence of the social problems. At age 7, the social adjustment of 96 extremely preterm (EP) children was assessed in a school setting, and 82 (85%) were followed at 11 years, and matched with three healthy term peers of the same sex and socioeconomic status (SES) recruited in the same classroom. A total of 375 children have been 'casted' by their classmates in social roles through a sociometric interview at 7 and 11 years. The findings indicate a customary stability in term children but persistent or even increasing problems of victimization in EP children and a decrease of aggressiveness over time in the EP boys subgroup. Moreover, we found persistent social isolation problems in the subgroup of EP girls at 7 and 11 years. It can be concluded that prematurity is associated with a process of social marginalization that results from both the children’s very limitations and the resultant reputation effects. At these ages, any discrepancy is quickly judged as a weakness that children do not want to be associated with. Furthermore, the passage of time confirms this and reinforces the marginalization process. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

The 2nd study involved a 2-yr investigation an English co-educational secondary school where single-sex mathematics classes were introduced for 1 cohort of pupils for 5 school terms, after which mixed-sex classes were introduced. Questionnaires were administered and interviews were conducted. Evidence relating to academic self-concept, pupil, parent and staff perceptions and academic achievement are discussed. Overall, the evidence suggests that co-educational environments create possible social/interaction disadvantages for girls, but that academic self-concept is not adversely affected by transferring from single-sex environments into mixed-sex ones.

Abstract = {In this paper an investigation is undertaken into the impact and effects, on both boys and girls, of implementing single-sex classes--but particularly as a strategy for engaging boys in the English classroom at one particular Catholic coeducational school in Perth, Western Australia. Semi-structured interviews with seven English teachers at this school, where the strategy was implemented, were used both to analyse teachers' perceptions of single-sex classes in the coeducational context and to gain some insight into their pedagogical approaches. The study found that particular assumptions and knowledges about gender informed specific pedagogical approaches were adopted by the teachers in single-sex English classes. These assumptions and knowledges and the way they informed the pedagogical practices of the teachers, even in the same school, varied radically. It is concluded that single-sex classes as a strategy per se do not necessarily produce enhanced social and educational outcomes for students. Rather, as indicated in the research, there needs to be more attention directed to the particular effects of pedagogy and the normalising assumptions about gender that inform the implementation of curriculum in both single-sex and coeducational classes.

Abstract = {Explored the value of introducing single-sex classes within co-educational schools, and draws upon the perspectives of girls and boys involved in one such initiative. Data were gathered from year 7 single-sex mathematics students from an inner-city comprehensive school. Students completed a questionnaire consisting of 9 questions covering 3 areas: (1) perceptions of differences between single-sex and mixed-sex mathematics classes and the best and worst features of single-sex classes; (2) perceptions of their relative achievement, enjoyment and confidence levels in single-sex and mixed-sex mathematics classes; and (3) views regarding the continuation of single-sex mathematics classes, and the possible extension of single-sex groups to other areas of the curriculum. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted focusing on 2 questions: (1) what students think about having single-sex classes for math; and (2) why the students believe that the school decided to have single-sex classes, and what reasons they were given. Results show that that girls-only classes may have positive effects for girls. However, curriculum-as-usual boys' classes do nothing to challenge the problematic macho male cultures inherent in schools; indeed, it may be the case that they actually exacerbate them.

Abstract = {Mobile technology–based interventions show promise for conveying HIV prevention information to Latino men who have sex with men (LMSM) and Latina transgender women (LTGW); however, implementing such interventions can pose serious challenges. To understand how to adapt existing interventions for these populations, we conducted nine focus groups (N = 91 participants, 52 LMSM, 39 LTGW) in Los Angeles, California. We used a rapid assessment process to create narrative reports that we examined using thematic analysis to explore differences across sites and between LMSM and LTGW. Lessons learned: requiring smartphone use could diminish participation of poor participants; sending personalized messages on the same days and times can help participants anticipate receiving study information; working with community partners is essential for building trust; recognizing different language literacies and diverse countries of origin can improve the cultural competency of intervention materials. Addressing these challenges may enhance efforts to address the HIV prevention needs of these communities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Best predictors in both experiments were end of 1st-year grade in the foreign language and a measure of phonology–orthography, foreign language word decoding. In 1 experiment, native language vocabulary skill was also a predictor of overall proficiency. Heretofore, foreign language grade and word decoding had not been considered as predictors of foreign language proficiency. The finding that foreign language word decoding was a good predictor of both oral and written proficiency suggests its importance as both a predictor variable and an important component of foreign language proficiency.

Abstract = {A sense of academic competence combines at least 2 forms of gender stereotyping: an illusory glow about performance on specific tasks, and traditional gender stereotyping about general perceptions of natural talent. Flexible categorization in terms of generality and content suggests a multifaceted model of Aspects of Self-Knowledge about Mathematics and English (ASK-ME). This paper demonstrates the flexibility of the ASK-ME model for adolescents (N = 1,360; aged 11–15 yrs) in 2 social contexts (coed and single-gender schools). The forms of gender stereotyping combine so that where traditional gender stereotyping was reduced at single-gender schools, an illusory glow had more influence. One outcome was that boys in single-gender settings expressed enhanced perceptions of performance in mathematics and language. Results highlight the importance of generality and content in understanding the gendered nature of academic self-concepts in social contexts. Implications are for differential influences on the plans and choices adolescents make about work and study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Compared the effects of single-sex and coeducational secondary schooling, using a random sample of 1,807 students in 75 Catholic high schools, 45 of which were single-sex institutions, drawn from the dataset of High School and Beyond study conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (1980). Whether concerning academic achievement, achievement gains, educational aspirations, locus of control, sex-role stereotyping, or attitudes and behaviors related to academics, results indicate that single-sex schools deliver specific advantages to their students, especially female students. In the recent focus on American secondary education, the relation between school organization and students' academic performance had been looked at critically. What has been considered by some to be an anachronistic organizational feature of schools may actually facilitate adolescent academic development by providing an environment where social and academic concerns are separated. It is suggested that a 2nd look at this disappearing school type is warranted. (37 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article by D. F. Halpern et al. (see record [rid]2011-23318-001[/rid]). The authors claim that there is no evidence to support positive effects of single-sex education. They acknowledge that 'without blind assessment, randomized assignment to treatment or control experiences, and consideration of selection factors, judging the effectiveness of innovations is impossible,' yet they cite only those studies that support their thesis. Halpern et al. seemed to question whether males and females respond differently to stress, despite abundant research that has been done in this area. They also claim that 'boys who spend more time with other boys become increasingly aggressive' and 'girls who spend more time with other girls become more sex-typed,' yet the source they cite as support studied children whose mean age was 52 months. It is interesting that the authors argue that there is no study using blind assessment and randomized assignments to support the idea that single-sex education leads to stronger outcomes. This is similar to the arguments that the tobacco industry used for years to argue that there was no causal (experimental) evidence to support the notion that cigarette smoking was harmful to one's health.

Abstract = {Explored the effects of parents' and peers' behavior in conversations concerning adolescents' school achievement. A total of about 60 male and female participants were 11.5–14.9 yrs old at 1st measurement of a longitudinal study; there were 2 other assessments at 1-yr intervals. The behavior of adolescents' partners (mothers, fathers, same-sex best friends) was audio-recorded during interactions in a plan-something-together task at 1st measurement. Grades in school and perceived school success were assessed at measurement points 1, 2, and 3. Overall findings suggest that parents and friends have an impact on school performance, but the number of significant associations was small. Parental control behavior had a negative effect on school achievement. There was also a negative effect on perceived school success of parental control actions, while supportive behaviors resulted in improvement of perceived academic performance. While short-term effects of parental challenges seemed to be more negative, the adolescents benefitted from parental challenges in the long run. Control by friends resulted in improvement in adolescents' perceived school performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {When the ten children to be studied were originally selected, differences in physical types and the motor aspects of behavior were not considered. At that time we would not have predicted the wide range of physical and motor differences that actually existed among these ten children so close in age and background-wide differences even between members of the same sex: how different Margaret's slow, large movements from Amy's short, quick ones; Allison's immobility of feature from Carol's expressive changes of countenance; Dick's vigorous puppy-like motility from Mark's calm restraint of movement. The questions remain: What did these children have in common as a group in postural habits, physical expressiveness or skills requiring refined coordinations? Were these common characteristics a function of their level of development? How much were they influenced by the quality of their immediate situation? This chapter describes these differences using findings from descriptive records in school situations and from check records during group singing and story reading.

Abstract = {Research Aim: This research aimed to provide an anecdotal perception of student substance use according to the teachers 'personal experience in the Irish secondary level educational setting. Methodology: Sampling: Interviews were conducted with teachers (n = 95) at 10 randomly selected schools in County Carlow in the South East of Ireland, as part of a doctoral research programme assessing youth substance use in the South Eastern Region. The school type included vocational, secondary in disadvantaged area, secondary in non-disadvantaged area, youth training centre, private school and both mixed/single sex schools. A letter from the researcher and a follow up phone call to each research site initiated contact with the school principal and explained briefly the nature and purpose of the research. Teachers from all grades were randomly sampled at each school after informed consent was gained. Research Design: The research emphasis was to access the views, perspectives and concerns of teachers and their experience of substance use and its impact in the classroom. Ethical approval of the interview basis was granted by the Ethics and Research Sub Group of Waterford Institute of Technology. The interview schema was piloted on a small sample of teachers in another region not partaking in this study. The interview contained questions regarding experience of substance abuse within the school setting, knowledge and recognition of substance use in students, awareness of school drug and alcohol policy, attitude toward substance misuse and drug education, awareness of drug availability in the area and knowledge of drug related services in their area. All interviews were coded to ensure confidentiality and participants gave permission for audio recording. The interviews took place in open plan areas and in the presence of an independent colleague. All interviews were transcribed. The themes analysis of interviews reported on the issues surrounding student substance use that arose for teachers, but also aimed to identify areas of similar and contrasting opinions. As such themes arose, the interviewee was encouraged to expand in a: 'lengthy conversation piece' (Simons, 1982, p. 37). Data Analysis: Zemke and Kramlinger's (1985) thematic analysis procedures were adopted and consisted of generating 'a list of key ideas, words, phrases, and verbatim quotes; using ideas to formulate categories and placing ideas and quotes in appropriate categories; and examining the contents of each category for subtopics and selecting the most frequent and most useful illustrations for the various categories' (Anderson, 2003). Conclusion: It was reported that the drug education in schools was 'haphazard, dissimilar and rather hit and miss' with not every class receiving drug education, others as part of religious education and Social Personal Health Education and the remainder being visited by the local drug education officer, a former addict or juvenile liaison officer. Teachers highlighted the need for information and teacher specific training in order to recognize the warning signs of adolescent problematic substance use, as many felt this social problem was impacting on their classroom and the academic performance of some students. Some teachers also reported not feeling comfortable with the delivery of drug educational material within their class time due to lack of appropriate training and lack of available time in their curriculum, in addition to feeling that this was not compatible with their role as educator.

Abstract = {Objectives: We examined associations between adolescents’ safety belt use and sexual orientation identity. Methods: We pooled data from the 2005 and 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (n = 26 468 weighted; mean age = 15.9 years; 35.4% White, 24.7% Black, 23.5% Latino, 16.4% other). We compared lesbian and gay (1.2%), bisexual (3.5%), and unsure (2.6%) youths with heterosexuals (92.7%) on a binary indicator of passenger safety belt use. We stratified weighted multivariable logistic regression models by sex and adjusted for survey wave and sampling design. Results: Overall, 12.6% of high school students reported 'rarely' or 'never' wearing safety belts. Sexual minority youths had increased odds of reporting nonuse relative to heterosexuals (48% higher for male bisexuals, 85% for lesbians, 46% for female bisexuals, and 51% for female unsure youths; P < .05), after adjustment for demographic (age, race/ethnicity), individual (body mass index, depression, bullying, binge drinking, riding with a drunk driver, academic achievement), and contextual (living in jurisdictions with secondary or primary safety belt laws, percentage below poverty, percentage same-sex households) risk factors. Conclusions: Public health interventions should address sexual orientation identity disparities in safety belt use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This project examined sources and consequences of attributions for achievement for boys and girls at co-ed (N = 663) and single-sex schools (N = 697). Overall attributions emphasised long and short term effort, over other personal (ability, liking) and social reasons (parents, teachers) or feeling good or bad on the day. Attributions were substantially similar for girls and boys, with particular variations in attributions to effort and ability at co-ed and not single-sex schools. Results suggested an illusory glow for boys more than girls in attributions to ability and effort for doing well in Mathematics and English, and traditional gender stereotyping in attributions to poor ability for not doing well in Mathematics. Results showed weak associations between attributions about effort and ability with intentions for Mathematics and English courses in senior high school. Findings suggest further research about personal and social sources of attributions in co-ed schools, and question the practical significance of attributions for achievement motivation.

Abstract = {Three questions were addressed using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988. First, are there differences between single-sex and coeducational Catholic secondary school students in academic and social psychological outcomes? Second, do these differences especially favor young women in single-sex schools? Third, can student pre-enrollment differences account for apparent sector effects? 756 8th graders in 1988 were followed up on 3 occasions, in 1990, 1992, and 1994. Results indicate that single-sex Catholic secondary schools were not especially favorable academic settings and that any advantages of attending these schools only benefited boys. However, any sector differences in student achievement test scores were explained by pre-enrollment differences in measured background and prior achievement. Recent changes in the demographic make-up of all Catholic high schools may account for the differences between these findings and prior research.

Abstract = {Purpose: Men who have sex with men (MSM) have nearly 80 times the lifetime risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) relative to men who have sex with women only (MSW), and young MSM (YMSM) accounted for 95% of estimated HIV diagnoses among adolescents between 13 and 24 years in 2015. We aimed to evaluate HIV education and sexual risk behaviors among YMSM relative to young MSW (YMSW) and to evaluate the relationship between HIV education and YMSM sexual risk behaviors. Methods: We used Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System data from 13 states that collected information on sex of sexual contacts and on HIV education in 2011 and/or 2013. We assessed HIV education, number of sexual partners ever and in the past three months, and condom use at last sex in logistic regression analyses controlling for age, race/ethnicity, state, and year. Results: YMSM were less likely to report school-based HIV education and more likely to report sexual risk behaviors relative to YMSW. HIV education was associated with reduced sexual risk behaviors among all students and with significant additional reductions in sexual risk behaviors among YMSM. Conclusion: There is a need for HIV education programs to reach YMSM, who are at increased risk of HIV. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988 (with subsamples of 3,483 and 409 8th graders living in mother-only and father-only homes, respectively) were used. Of the 35 social psychological and educational outcomes studied, the authors cannot find one in which both males and females benefit significantly from living with their same-sex parent. Multivariate analysis identifies only 4 outcomes in which the interaction between the sex of the parent and the sex of the child is significant; moreover, the direction of the interaction effects for these 4 items runs counter to same-sex expectations. These findings cast doubt on the same-sex argument. Composite variables are appended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

A proposed model of parental perceptions as mediating influences of past performances on adolescents' self-perceptions was evaluated for variations in content and social context. Adolescent self-disclosure to parents about academic achievement was also explored. Results indicate that parent–adolescent agreement was stronger with mothers than fathers and for aspects of self-knowledge that made direct inferences about abilities (performance, talent), rather than indirect inferences (effort, task difficulty) in both Mathematics and English. Results were similar in coed and single-sex contexts. Adolescent self-disclosure to parents suggested an important addition to the model of family influences on the adolescents' sense of academic achievement.

Israeli twin pairs were matched with a same-sex pair of singletons reared in the same educational group. Data were collected from the children, teachers, parents, and caretakers. In Swedish schools and Israeli kibbutzim, permissiveness–restrictiveness varied, depending on perspective (perceived or imposed) and on content (type of subject or rule-breaking activity). Preliminary within-pair comparisons for Swedish twins for different types of test results indicated that logical abstract thinking as well as reading and mathematics achievement were less influenced by hereditary factors in a restrictive educational setting than in a permissive one.

Abstract = {Analyzed the effects of parents' occupational status, teachers' encouragement for further study, and high school curriculum on 1,039 Australian girls' academic achievement in girls' and coeducational schools in 2 states during the Ss' senior year. Multiple regression analysis indicated that mother's education was the most important independent predictor of the type of school attended. Attendance at a girls' school was a significant predictor of exposure to key social influences, enrollment in a science course, and academic achievement in only 1 state. Findings support attempts in Australia to provide single-sex classrooms for science and mathematics courses. A model of girls' academic achievement is also discussed.

Abstract = {Reports an analysis of behavior and talk for individuals and single-sex pairs using a computer-based drill and practice activity to explain differences in performance. Ss were 87 boys and girls (5–6 years old), including controls, in Year One classes. An addition practice program written for schools was selected, which used Mickey Mouse as the central character. Results indicate that individuals were more likely to be task-focused and to complete tasks successfully than children working in pairs. Differences were found in off-task activity, behaviors, and type of talk. Grouping and verbal interaction are discussed in relation to the type of task that children are asked to undertake, and how both task and peer presence may constrain the child's task focus and performance when reinforcing pre-existing knowledge. Authors conclude that these findings provide a compelling argument for recommending individual use of the computer for this type of activity.

Ss were 282 children in Grades 5–7 who solved puzzles independently, but side-by-side in same-sex, same-grade pairs. Performance was experimentally manipulated to produce high and low performers in each pair and successful and unsuccessful pairs. Results indicate that regardless of reward contingencies, success or failure played a critical role in perceptions of individual differences. Failure depressed perceptions of the other student's ability in each pair and decreased reward allocations for both low and high performers.

Abstract = {The purposes of the present investigation were (a) to compare the effects of single-sex and coed high schools on achievements, attitudes and behaviors and (b) to determine whether attending single-sex schools affected well-established sex differences in these variables. Subjects were 2,332 Catholic high school students attending one of 47 single-sex or 33 coed schools included in the nationally representative High School and Beyond (HSB) study. The effects of school type, sex, and their interaction on senior year outcomes and postsecondary activities were examined after controlling for variables measured during the sophomore year. Changes in a wide variety of outcomes during this critical sophomore-to-senior period were nearly unaffected by school type. Changes in many of these outcomes were related to sex, but these sex differences were also nearly unaffected by school type. Interpretations of this study contradict those of earlier studies that were also based on large nationally representative data bases, but the differences were apparently explicable in terms of methodological problems identified in the earlier studies.

The partner's attractiveness and academic performance were systematically varied in 4 conditions: high attractiveness/high grades, high attractiveness/low grades, low attractiveness/high grades, and low attractiveness/low grades. After reading the vignette, the students rated the partner's popularity. As hypothesized, analyses of variance revealed that attractive partners were significantly more popular than unattractive partners, regardless of whether the partner had high or low grades.

Second, we strongly oppose the use of status at the end of students' sophomore year as a 'pretest' control. Third, we challenge Marsh's summary of single-sex school effects in standardized (β) regression coefficients, artifactually small in this instance, which we contrast with more conventional standardized effect-size estimates. We reiterate our findings supporting the effectiveness of single-sex schools, which sit within a growing body of evidence suggesting positive effects on academic outcomes that accrue to young women in these contexts.

Through the use of qualitative methodology, this study sought to illuminate the stories of participants in an effort to understand and shed light on the complexities facing high-ability girls today. Using data collected over the course of an academic year, this study examined learning through the eyes of 20 high-achieving female 11th grade students (aged 16 and 17 yrs) enrolled in single-sex and coeducational secondary schools. Learning and success in school was described by the participants as the result of taking an active stance toward the material and understanding their style preferences, which included an inclination for learning within contexts and a tendency to study alone. Engagement, strategy use, environment, and context all played a role in the learning process for the high-achieving female participants. Implications for classroom practice are included.

Abstract = {Tested the hypothesis that academic achievement affects different components of self-concept in 230 16–17 yr olds. Further, the authors investigated the possible influence of nationality (Slovenia, France) in modifying the relationship between academic achievement and self-concept. The results of two-factor (academic achievement × nationality) analyses of variance and discriminant analyses showed significant correlations between academic achievement and various indices of self-concept, which varied in a nationality-dependent fashion. The French subjects exceeded Slovenians in some domains of self-concept (i.e. verbal, academic, relations with same sex peers, relations with parents, religion and spirituality, and general self-concept), while Slovenian subjects exceeded French subjects in the domain of problem solving and creativity. There was no significant difference between both national samples in self-esteem. Also, the French subjects exceeded Slovenian pupils in general academic achievement. The results were interpreted on the grounds of theoretical expectations related to the formation of self-concept and academic achievement, as well as on the basis of national differences in the school system and personality structure.

Lee and Bryk (1989) addressed some of my concerns, but did not adequately address important criticisms of their study that are outlined briefly here. On the basis of these studies, I conclude that changes in a wide variety of outcome variables are nearly unaffected by school type during this critical sophomore-to-senior period and that this lack of single-sex/coeducation difference is consistent for boys and for girls.

Results indicate no significant differences between the performance of boys and girls. 166 Ss then chose to do 1 experiment from 6 biology, chemistry, and physics experiments and were rated according to how well they conducted the experiment and how long they took. Findings show that chemistry topics were most popular among all Ss. Physics was least popular among girls but not boys. Girls took the same amount of time to do the experiments as boys, refuting the notion that girls work more slowly and thoroughly than boys. No advantages to having single-sex classes in single-sex or mixed-sex schools were evidenced. (10 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Self reports of social groups were compared with the social groups identified by a consensus judgment of their peers. 138 Chinese 4th graders (mean age 9.91 yrs) and 167 7th graders (mean age 13.09 yrs) were asked to identify the social groups within their grades, including their own groups. The Ss also rated themselves on multiple domains of competence. Their teachers rated them on the same domains. Ss tended to be biased toward self-enhancement when reporting their own groups, omitting members with low scholastic ranking and unfavorable scores on teacher ratings of competence. All groups were comprised of Ss from the same classroom and virtually all (98%) of the same sex. Members scored similarly on teacher ratings of competence. In elementary school, conventional values and academic achievement provided the bases for peer group cohesion. In early adolescence, peer-related concerns supplemented those conventional values.

Abstract = {Background: Anecdotal evidence suggests that men who have sex with men (MSM) are increasingly combining sex and illicit drugs (an activity referred to as ‘chemsex’), in particular GHB/GBL, ketamine, crystal meth, or mephedrone (here called 4-chems). Use of such drugs has been associated with mental health and sexual health harms. We aim to compare patterns of illicit drug use among MSM in 44 European urban centres. Methods: In 2010, EMIS recruited 174,209 men from 38 countries to an anonymous online questionnaire in 25 languages. As harm reduction services for drugs and sex are organised at a local level, we chose to compare cities rather than countries. We defined 44 cities based on region/postal code and settlement size. For multivariable regression analyses, three comparison groups of MSM not living in these cities were applied: MSM living in Germany, the UK, and elsewhere in Europe. Results: Data from 55,446 MSM living in 44 urban centres were included. Use of 4-chems (past 4 weeks) was highest in Brighton (16.3%), Manchester (15.5%), London (13.2%), Amsterdam (11.2%), Barcelona (7.9%), Zurich (7.0%) and Berlin (5.3%). It was lowest in Sofia (0.4%). The rank order was largely consistent when controlling for age, HIV diagnosis, and number of sexual partners. City of residence was the strongest demographic predictor of chemsex-drug use. Conclusion: Use of drugs associated with chemsex among MSM varies substantially across European cities. As city is the strongest predictor of chemsex-drug use, effective harm reduction programmes must include structural as well as individual interventions.

Abstract = {Reports an error in 'Single-sex public education for low-income youth of color: A critical theoretical review' by Sara Goodkind (Sex Roles, Advanced Online Publication, Oct 9, 2012, np). The original article erroneously states that it was 2006 changes to Title IX that eased legal impediments to single-sex public education in the United States. Title IX was not amended. Instead, the U.S. Department of Education issued new regulations concerning single-sex schooling in 2006. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-33195-001[/rid]). There has been a widespread increase in single-sex public schooling in the U.S. following 2006 amendments to Title IX stipulated by the No Child Left Behind Act. As its inclusion in No Child Left Behind demonstrates, single-sex public schooling is viewed as a means to improve the educational experiences and performance of low-income youth of color. Yet little is known about the effects and efficacy of single-sex public education, particularly for these populations. This piece provides a critical theoretical review of this issue. It examines the three main rationales offered by proponents of single-sex education for low-income youth of color, who contend that it will 1) eliminate distraction by and harassment from the other sex; 2) address the different learning styles of girls and boys; and 3) remedy past inequities experienced by low-income populations of color by offering them opportunities afforded to more privileged youth. The review reveals no documented benefits to single-sex public education for low-income youth of color and a number of concerns. Thus, it recommends that policy makers reconsider devoting scarce resources to this practice, which ultimately has the potential to further marginalize low-income youth of color by reinforcing racialized stereotypes of hypersexuality, reproducing narrow and restrictive definitions of gender, invalidating the experiences and identities of GLBTQ youth, and diverting attention from the need to address poverty and racism.

Abstract = {As any classroom teacher can tell you, there are discernible differences in the way girls and boys learn. This engaging, practical guide examines how girls' unique sensory, physical, cognitive, and emotional characteristics affect their performance in the classroom, and shows you how to adapt classroom experiences to assist girls' learning, particularly in math and science. Abigail Norfleet James provides research-based findings to build your understanding of how females learn differently, whether in coed or single-sex settings, and clarifies assumptions held by both teachers and students about themselves. Inside, readers will find: specific instructional techniques and practical applications for differentiating instruction in math and science; ways of dealing with girls' stress; up-to-date findings on styles of learning and math anxiety; resources, figures, and charts, as well as quizzes in each chapter that introduce the topic and challenge preconceived notions of learning differences.

Observations were obtained in 20 Australian Year 5 classrooms in which students were working on an electricity topic. The teachers involved were selected as 10 pairs, matched for sex, educational background, and teaching experience. Half the teachers (the experimental group) were alerted to the possibilities of sexism in the physical sciences. In classes of the experimental group teachers, the same pattern of activity was found for boys and girls in mixed-sex and single-sex groups, a pattern also found in single-sex groups in the control group classes. Mixed-sex groups in the control group classes involved lower participation rates for girls than for boys. It is concluded that single-sex grouping may be beneficial to girls' science education in certain circumstances. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Results indicate that interpersonal, economic, and cultural parental resources explain much of the difference in academic achievement among children from step- and mother/father households. Children living with a same-sex biological parent had lower educational expectations than children living with an opposite-sex biological parent. However, although both boys and girls tend to fare better in mother/stepfather than in father/stepmother households, children do not appear to be more disturbed by the entrance of an opposite-sex than of a same-sex stepparent.

Abstract = {Objective: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the largest group of individuals in the U.S. living with HIV and have the greatest number of new infections. This study was designed to test a brief, culturally relevant prevention intervention for HIV-infected MSM, which could be integrated into HIV care. Method: HIV-infected MSM who received HIV care in a community health center (N = 201), and who reported HIV sexual transmission-risk behavior (TRB) in the prior 6 months, were randomized to receive the intervention or treatment as usual. The intervention, provided by a medical social worker, included proactive case management for psychosocial problems, counseling about living with HIV, and HIV TRB risk reduction. Participants were followed every 3 months for one year. Results: Participants, regardless of study condition, reported reductions in HIV TRB, with no significant differential effect by condition in primary intent-to-treat analyses. When examining moderators, the intervention was differentially effective in reducing HIV TRB for those who screened in for baseline depression, but this was not the case for those who did not screen in for depression. Conclusions: The similar level of reduction in HIV TRB in the intervention and control groups, consistent with other recent secondary prevention interventions, speaks to the need for new, creative designs, or more potent interventions in secondary HIV prevention trials, as the control group seemed to benefit from risk assessment, study contact, and referrals provided by study staff. The differential finding for those with depression may suggest that those without depression could reap benefits from limited interventions, but those with a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis may require additional interventions to modify their sexual risk behaviors.

Abstract = {By adolescence, men's participation and achievement in science exceeds women's. This article reports a case study that examined the beginnings of this gender differentiation during a naturally occurring academic activity that was designed to support and guide young children's interest in doing science. Data were collected during 2 successive years of a science fair for a total of 489 children (half female, half male) in Grades 1–6 of a progressive private school. A total of 268 projects were characterized in terms of achievement and area of science. Parents provided information about the way children selected and created projects. In both years and in all grade levels, boys tended to choose to work in the physical sciences, and girls in the biological and social sciences. Peer collaborations were exclusively same sex. Achievement and parental involvement were not gender related. Factors are discussed that might lead to an early divergence of boys' and girls' interests in science within a context that promotes its exploration.

Abstract = {Examined (a) whether girlfriends function as significant-others in the male achievement process and (b) whether girlfriends and best friends (same sex) provide educational encouragement on the basis of the same adolescent performance criteria as do adults. Analysis supported the hypothesis that girlfriends are significant-others and that peers evaluate a youth's potential over broader criteria than do his parents. The limitations of the study and the suggestive nature of the findings are discussed. Analysis was based on 15-yr interval panel data for 137 males. Estimates were produced by multiple regression.

Abstract = {Administered the Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Questionnaire, along with measures of attributions and academic achievement, to 655 5th and 6th graders from primarily low SES backgrounds in Australia and to 498 6th graders from a cross-section of SES backgrounds in Australia. Separate factor analyses of responses from the 2 groups were similar and demonstrated the 7 factors that the SDQ is designed to measure: Physical Abilities, Physical Appearance, Relations with Peers, Relations with Parents, Reading, Mathematics, and School Subjects. Consistent and predictable correlations were observed between the self-concept dimensions and attributions of responsibility for academic outcomes, academic achievement, and the sex of S. Smaller sex differences were observed for Ss who attended single-sex classes, suggesting that these Ss might be using a different reference group in forming their self-concepts. Results support the theory that self-concept is multidimensional and hierarchically arranged. They demonstrate that academic achievement is uncorrelated with self-concept in nonacademic areas, significantly correlated with self-concept in academic areas, and most highly related in the academic area most directly related to area of achievement being considered. Findings support the construct validity of self-concept and the validity of interpretations based on the SDQ. (44 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {2,029 10th and 12th graders from 5 coeducational, 4 all-female, and 4 all-male high schools completed measures of value climate and environmental press (High School Characteristics Index) to evaluate the hypotheses that, compared with single-sex schools, coeducational schools would be perceived by their students as placing (a) less emphasis on scholarship and achievement; (b) greater emphasis on affiliation and pleasurable, nonacademic activities; and (c) less emphasis on control and discipline. Support was attained for Hypotheses 2 and 3, whereas the evidence relevant to Hypothesis 1 was inconsistent. Results confirm those of other studies in suggesting that, at least from the perspective of most students, coeducational schools enjoy an advantage both in terms of attending to social–emotional needs and minimizing the necessity of regimentation and discipline.

Abstract = {Describes sex differences in science and reading achievement and attitudes for nationwide samples of 14-yr-olds in the US (5,193 Ss), Sweden (2,324 Ss), and England (2,777 Ss). There are largely the same sex differences in all 3 countries: Males and females have similar reading skills, while females have more positive reading habits; males outperform females in science, with the smallest difference observed for biology; males have more positive attitudes toward science, except that females believe science to be at least as important a topic as males do. There is no noteworthy increase in sex distinctions with an additional year of schooling, from Grades 8 to 9. However, in English coeducational schools, females show a deceleration in science and vocabulary achievement relative to their male peers. Females in English one-sex schools exceed their male counterparts in reading and several science Ss. It is hypothesized that the role of successful female teachers and peers, and the absence of social pressure from males may facilitate females' learning in these areas. A study is proposed of specific school practices and the ways in which they determine sex discrepancies. (28 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

The sequence by which Ss were exposed to examiners within each sex was counterbalanced. A 2  2  2 analysis of variance with 2 between variables (sequence and sex of S) and 1 within variable (sex of examiner) was completed using the sum of the test scores obtained under the 3 male examiners and the 3 female examiners as the 2 dependent variable scores for each S.

Abstract = {Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) and female sex workers (FSW) are more likely to be living with HIV and experience difficulty accessing HIV health services due to stigma and discrimination. Antiretroviral treatment and sustained viral suppression among individuals living with HIV is the last step in the continuum of HIV care, which has been shown to improve health outcomes and decrease the risk of onward transmission of HIV. Methods: To calculate the numerator and denominator for antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage estimates among MSM and FSW living with HIV, the Priority Locations for AIDS Control Efforts methods were modified to include individual quantitative interviews, health service assessment and mapping, and size estimation in 7 cities in Cameroon. MSM and FSW were recruited using peer referral and venue-based sampling. The numerator was calculated from interviews with MSM and FSW. Population size estimation of MSM and FSW was used to determine the denominator. Results: Antiretroviral coverage varied by site from 0% to 25% among HIV infected MSM and FSW. ART provision to the general population was reported at a significantly greater proportion of HIV health centers (56.5%) than ART provision to MSM and FSW populations (13.2%). Conclusions: The majority of MSM and FSW living with HIV and eligible for treatment in Cameroon are not connected to ART care. Additionally, ART provision for MSM and FSW at HIV health centers is insufficient. Characterizing effective strategies to reach optimal levels of engagement in the continuum of HIV care among MSM and FSW is essential for an AIDS-free generation for Cameroon.

Abstract = {Assessed the etiology of the covariation between mathematics performance and general cognitive ability in data from a sample of 555 twins selected for learning deficits (310 monozygotic [MZ] and 245 same-sex dizygotic [DZ] twin pairs) and from a sample of 570 control twin pairs (319 MZ and 251 same-sex DZ twins). The age range for all Ss was 8–20 yrs. Subtests of the Wide Range Achievement Test and the Peabody Individual Achievement Test were used as measures of mathematics performance, whereas the verbal IQ and performance IQ scores from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Revised (WISC--R) or Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Revised (WAIS--R) were used as measures of general cognitive ability. In both samples, results of fitting bivariate genetic structural equation models to the data indicated that approximately 90% of the variability in a latent factor for math performance and 80% of that from general cognitive ability were due to genetic effects. In addition, almost 90% of the phenotypic correlation between math performance and general cognitive ability was due to heritable influences in both samples. Thus, the phenotypic relationship between mathematics performance and general cognitive ability latent factors is due primarily to genetic influences.

Abstract = {Globally, men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for HIV. Many HIV-prevention efforts rely on community outreach and mobilization to engage MSM. This study examines peer relationships and their potential role in HIV prevention through 31 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 121 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 363 MSM across 15 sites in India. Results indicate that MSM receive social support in friendships, sex-worker collaborations, constructed kin relationships, and romantic partnerships. Access to these relationships, however, is uneven across MSM, and can carry risks of disclosure of same-sex behavior and exclusion based on HIV-positive status. Positive peer relationships can serve as the basis of community empowerment, education, and couple-based interventions for MSM, and peer counselors can also provide a buffer against the social risks of peer relationships and facilitate linkage to care and continued engagement in treatment. These insights can improve HIV interventions for MSM in India and elsewhere. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Strangely there is no validated scale in India to measure the construct. This paper describes the adaptation of H. W. Marsh's (1989) Self-Description Questionnaire I, II, III for 12 to 16-yr-old children and ascertains its validity for the target population of students. The scale was translated in Hindi by the 2 experts and the author. The opposite sex and same sex peer relations dimension were dropped as the government schools at this level were exclusively for boys or girls and opportunities for out of school inter-sex mingling were nearly absent. The scale containing 84 items of 8 dimensions was administered to 150 11–14 yr old students. The scale was found to have internal consistency, and to be valid for measuring academic self-concept in junior and senior high school students.

The associations of race (AA and EA) and sex to children's dyadic friendship choices was examined longitudinally for 80 male and 65 female elementary school students across Grades 1–3 and Grades 4–6. At Time 1 and Time 2, children completed a friendship nominations questionnaire. Based upon the class roster, mutual (reciprocated) friendship nominations were determined. Both group and individual change analyses indicated that the children's proportion of same sex and same race mutual friendships increased with age. Boys, but not girls, increased in their proportion of same-sex/cross-race mutual friends as they got older. Generally, sex appeared to be a more salient consideration in friendship choices than race. Finally, sex and race of peers were associated with individual changes in the number of mutual friends a child had relative to classmates.

Abstract = {Developed a questionnaire methodology to determine students' views on sex education (SE) and their knowledge of risks related to sexual health. 3,314 students (Year 11) in Britain assessed their school SE. Over 70% answered that their SE had included 'a lot' or 'some' education on sexual intercourse, contraception and STDs; 45% personal morality; and 36% assertiveness training. Ss' assessment of SE was varied but only 44% considered it satisfactory. Over 70% thought teaching a wide range of topics should start in Year 8, 75% wanted outside agencies involved in the teaching, 57% did not want parents to provide 'most of it' and 70% did not want it taught in single-sex groups. School was the most frequently specified source of 'most helpful' information on STDs and contraception. Results suggest that the aim to develop a tool for evaluating SE has been achieved.

Abstract = {Presents a path analytic model of status expectations that focuses on how sex influences the educational and occupational expectations of a large sample (3,200 students) of American adolescents. While female and male expectations can be predicted by the same model variables, the process is by no means identical for both sexes. Exogenous background variables had greater total effects for females, while intervening social-psychological and achievement related variables had substantially lesser effects for females than males. The same-sex parent was found to have a greater effect on adolescent expectations than the opposite-sex parent. No significant sex differences were evident in the mean level of either expectation, but the distribution of occupational choices paralleled the prevailing sex segregation of the occupational sector. Further, relative to academic achievement, the females had lower expectations than the males. Results are interpreted as consequences for traditional sex role socialization.

Abstract = {Examined the relationships between the social origins of girls, their views of their own abilities, their high school curricula, their teachers' encouragement, and their actual academic achievements within both single-sex and co-educational high schools. Ss consisted of 1,108 Australian Grade 12 students attending different types of schools. Complex patterns of relationships among these variables were found that appeared to operate differently in each school type. Of particular interest was the impact of a working mother on her daughter's achievements within different types of schools. It is concluded that the key factors in girls' achievements do not all operate to favor one group of girls. (34 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined students' preferences for counselor characteristics and addressed the following questions: Do the present data support the attraction and repulsion hypothesis? How do Ss rank 8 school counselor characteristics? Is the rank order of counselor characteristics by these Ss significantly correlated to rank orders reported in previous research? 66 high school students (aged 15–20 yrs) completed a comprehensive counseling needs assessment, including the Preferences for School Counselor Characteristics Questionnaire, designed to measure students' preference for 8 counselor characteristics relative to each other. Results indicate that preference for similarity scores were significantly higher than preference for different scores. Rank ordered preferences for counselor characteristics were as follows: (1) same attitudes and values, (2) same background and socioeconomic status, (3) same sex, (4) same race, (5) opposite sex, (6) different background and socioeconomic status, (7) different race, and (8) different attitudes and values. In addition, the Spearman rank-order correlations among the various studies were generally high and statistically significant. It is concluded that issues of similarity and difference are integral to understanding the nature of counseling relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {To determine whether type of school attended affects adolescents' self-esteem, locus of control, and affiliation needs, 896 male and 779 female 10th-yr students from 16 Australian nongovernment schools were studied. 79% attended single-sex schools. Major results indicate that type of school attended affected Ss' stated preferences and rated achievement in subjects. Ss attending coeducational schools had more traditional subject preferences and assessments of achievement in those subject areas than Ss attending single-sex schools. Ss attending coeducational schools also had lower self-esteem and greater affiliation with peers than Ss from single-sex schools. However, sex differences mediated these associations.

The sample consisted of 216 middle-class, White, 6–11 yr old, same-sex twin children. Pairs were randomly split into 2 subgroups for cross-validation. Two factors, Impatience-Aggression and Competitive Achievement-Striving, were derived and cross-validated. These MYTH factors were internally consistent and replicated the study by Matthews and Angulo. The construct validity of the MYTH subscales was partially supported by evidence of relationships between these components of Type A behavior and teacher-ratings of the child's competence in specific domains. Children's ratings of their competence and perceptions of global self-worth were not related to total MYTH or subscale scores. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated the role of gender composition of school on body figure preferences, eating disorder symptomology, and role concerns. Questionnaires were completed by 261 adolescent girls (mean age 16.1 yrs) in 2 private single-sex and 2 private coeducational school environments. Results show that there was no difference in nominated ideal figure or eating disorder scores between the schools. However, girls in the single-sex schools placed a greater emphasis on achievement than their counterparts at the coeducational schools. These role concerns had a differential impact on prediction of the ideal figure, whereby the importance placed on intelligence and professional success predicted the choice of a thinner ideal figure for the single-sex schools, but a larger ideal for the coeducational schools. It was concluded that the motivation for thinness differs between single-sex and coeducational schools. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {This article discusses the African American lesbian gang, DTO (Dykes Taking Over), as an example of a student-initiated strategy for dealing with homophobic bullying in an urban American school district. A series of alleged incidents of same-sex sexual harassment by gang members on heterosexual students illustrate how lesbian/bisexual threat was used by these women to re-establish a power differential after they experienced bullying based on their sexuality and gender expression. A series of alleged incidents of same-sex sexual harassment by gang members on female heterosexual students illustrate how gay/bisexual threat was used by these women to re-establish a power differential after they experienced bullying based on their sexuality and gender expression. This article considers how these students were reacting, perhaps preemptively and in retaliation, to homophobia in their schools, particularly from their peers, forming gangs and using same sex sexual harassment of other students as a weapon against homophobia and a means by which they could assert themselves in their masculinities, not unlike their male peers who experience same sex bullying and/or harassment and use anti-female sexual harassment to assert their masculinity. Intersections of gender, race, ethnicity, class, and sexuality frame several major questions that arise from these considerations, including: Might their masculinities be uniquely related to their performances of bullying? (How) could homophobic bullying be framed with sexual harassment in both policy and practice? Would this framing benefit or harm students who are bullied? How would/does that change the way we can handle it in schools (i.e., school policies), if at all? Implications for school-based practitioners are discussed with regard to how these students' behavior might be the result of a lack of programs and services available for LGBTQ and same gender loving youth both in and after school.

Abstract = {90 female pupils (aged 15–16 yrs) from a single-sex secondary grammar school completed the Cognitive Styles Analysis which assessed their position on the Wholist-Analytic and Verbal-Imagery learning style dimensions. Ss were asked to select their preferred format of a single-sheet handout on study skills which was offered in 3 modes: Unstructured-Verbal, Structured-Verbal, and Structured-Pictorial. Each mode contained the same information and differed only in format. On the format preference, there was a significant effect of the Verbal-Imagery dimension, with the majority of Verbalizers choosing the Structured-Verbal sheet and the Imagers opting for the Structured-Pictorial version. There was a smaller effect on the Wholist-Analytic dimension, on which Wholists had a preference for the Structured-Pictorial and the Analytics for the Structured-Verbal version. The findings are discussed in terms of their practical implications for a differentiated approach to instruction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Unlike conventional ANOVA, which aggregates each S's ratings of the members of a group, the round robin procedure permits the assessment of the effects of individual dyadic relationships on expressed preferences, and can therefore provide additional information on the processes involved in preference formation. The impact of both race and sex on sociometric choices was explored using these 2 techniques. Although conventional ANOVA showed strong same-race preferences, round robin ANOVA revealed that individual relationships were more important than race in forming peer preferences. A high degree of reciprocity of Ss' ratings of each other was found both within and between racial groups. Both conventional and round robin analyses found strong same-sex preferences, and much less reciprocity of ratings between the sexes than within the sexes. The complementary uses of conventional and round robin analyses of sociometric data are discussed. (36 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The Catholic school of today, the authors show, is a very different institution from the Catholic school of thirty years ago.

Boys outperformed girls overall, with sex differences becoming significantly more polarized in the mixed-sex dyads. Exp 2 involved 96 Ss, with individual pre- and posttests, and compared co-action dyads (as in Exp 1) with interaction pairs in which the pair members worked together at a single computer with no restriction on interaction. The polarization of sex differences in the mixed sex dyads was once again found in the co-action condition, but not in the interaction condition. Results are interpreted in terms of processes of social comparison, which appear to be more potent in this situation than any straightforward domination of resources.

Abstract = {Nomination procedures for assessing peer behaviors are in wide use, and mixed-sex peer nominations are often utilized under the assumption that combined same- and opposite-sex nominations yield a representative picture of children's behaviors and relationships to other variables. Analyses of nominations made by 457 Turkish 3rd and 5th graders for 14 peer behaviors and for liked-/disliked-a-lot illustrate the productiveness of separately assessing same-sex and opposite-sex nominations, showing that (1) a bias toward more nominations for same-sex peers is not consistent over all behaviors; and (2) although same-sex and combined same-/opposite-sex nominations are strongly related, the agreement between same- and opposite-sex nominations is substantially lower. The outcome is that (1) sociometric status classification depends on the nominating population and (2) the relationship between peer-assessed behaviors and peer acceptance/peer sociometric status can different, depending upon whether the reference group is same- or opposite-sex peers. Findings bring into question the routine use of mixed-sex nominations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

For males, fathers, family members other than the nuclear family, adult friends or acquaintances, and peer friends of the same sex seem to be most influential. For females, peer friends of the same sex, mothers, fathers, and other relatives not members of the nuclear family seem most influential.

Abstract = {Investigated the relationship between self-perception and academic achievement among 116 3rd-grade Black and White disadvantaged children. Race, sex, IQ, self-perception, and student's perception of their teacher's perceptions were examined as sources of variance in academic achievement. A stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that self-perceptions accounted for more variance in academic achievement for Ss who are of the same sex and race as the teacher than for those who are not. It was also found that self-perceptions of Black Ss in all-Black classrooms accounted for more variance in respect to achievement than did self-perceptions of Blacks in integrated classrooms.

Abstract = {This is a 2-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 96) of a behavioral intervention (4 group and 4 individual sessions) integrating risk reduction counseling with counseling to foster self-acceptance in MSM in India compared to enhanced standard of care (ESOC). Both conditions involved HIV and STI testing and counseling at baseline and 6-months, and assessments of condomless sex at baseline, 3-, and 6-months. A significant condition by time interaction suggested a difference in the rate of change in number of anal sex acts without condoms in the intervention versus ESOC (p < 0.0001). Post hoc contrasts suggested that the overall difference was due to intervention-response at 3-months. The incidence of bacterial STIs was 17.5 % in the intervention condition and a 28.6 % in ESOC. Addressing self-acceptance and related psychosocial concerns in the context sexual risk reduction counseling for MSM in India was feasible and acceptable. Testing the intervention for efficacy is justified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the influence of self-concept and achievement motivation on sex- role perception (SRP) of 360 adolescent Indian boys and girls from single sex and coeducational schools in the 8th, 9th, and 10th standard. Assessment was by the 72-item Sex Role Inventory and the 22-item Self Concept Scale. Ss were classified as liberal, neutral, or conservative in SRP; self-concept was classified as good, moderate, or poor. Achievement motivation was assessed using a 20-item scale developed by G. Rau (1974). Only Ss living with both parents were included. Results reveal that SRP had significant positive relationship with self-concept and achievement motivation. Ss with good self-concept were more liberal in SRP, and Ss with high achievement motivation were more liberal in sex-role perception as well.

Data from a national longitudinal study of adolescent health were examined. 632 13–18 yr olds reporting same sex and both-sex romantic attractions were compared with those reporting other-sex attractions. Results show that youths who reported same sex or both-sex romantic attraction were more likely to experience extreme forms of violence than youths who reported other sex attraction. Youths reporting same-sex and both-sex romantic attractions were also more likely to witness violence. The higher incidence of violence perpetrated by youths attracted to the same sex is explained by their experiences of violence. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Dimensions of classroom social behavior of 142 male and 42 female children (aged 6 yrs 10 mo to 15 yrs 9 mo) were rated by 85 regular classroom teachers, using a social behavior assessment inventory. Half of the children were emotionally disabled, and the other half consisted of same-sex classroom peers who were not emotionally disabled. 6 relatively independent factors were identified as dimensions of Ss' classroom social behavior: Academic Responsibility, Social Responsibility, Cooperation, Compliance, Adaptive Behavior, and Participation. These 6 factors accounted for over two-thirds of the variance in teacher ratings. Consistent with past research, teachers appeared to consider those academic-related social skills associated with classroom order and control particularly salient. It is concluded that the assessment of children's social skills should be multifactored in nature, and social skills assessment within a multitrait-multimethod framework should clarify the underlying dimensions of children's social behavior. Recommendations concerning multifactored assessment of children's social skills are discussed. (63 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Compared children with and without cross-sex friends (CSFs) on measures of social and cognitive competence, endorsement of sex-role stereotypes, and family composition. 377 female and 346 male 3rd and 4th graders (61.2% White, 35% Black) completed sociometric assessments of peer acceptance, friendship, and behavioral reputation; as well as self-reports of perceived self competence and endorsement of sex role stereotypes. In addition, teachers completed ratings of Ss' social and cognitive competence. 92 Ss, about 14% of the sample, had 1 or more reciprocal opposite-sex friends; for 21 of these Ss, their CSFs were their primary or only friends. Black Ss were more likely than White Ss to have CSFs. Comparisons of Ss who had primarily or only CSFs to matched groups of Ss who had only same-sex friends (SSFs) and to Ss who had CSFs secondarily to SSFs revealed differences between the Ss in social competence and relationships with peers. Ss with primarily CSFs had poorer social skills than other Ss with friends, although they were less stereotyped about sex roles than other Ss. In contrast, Ss with CSFs secondarily to SSFs were as well adjusted socially as Ss with only SSFs. Results suggest that Ss with CSFs differ among themselves, depending on primacy of the CSF relationship. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Appearance-related disturbances are common among HIV-infected MSM; however, to date, there have been limited options in the valid assessment of this construct. The aim of the current study was to assess the structural, internal, and convergent validity of the Assessment of Body Change Distress Questionnaire (ABCD) and its short version. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated that both versions fit the data well. Four subfactors were revealed measuring the following body disturbance constructs: (1) negative affect about appearance, (2) HIV health-related outcomes and stigma, (3) eating and exercise confusion, and (4) ART non-adherence. The subfactors and total scores revealed bivariate associations with salient health outcomes, including depressive symptoms, HIV sexual transmission risk behaviors, and ART non-adherence. The ABCD and its short form, offer valid means to assess varied aspects of body image disturbance among HIV-infected MSM, and require modest participant burden.

Abstract = {Stigma has been shown to increase vulnerability to HIV acquisition in many settings around the world. However, limited research has been conducted examining its role among men who have sex with men (MSM) in India, whose HIV prevalence is far greater than the general population. In 2009, 210 MSM in Chennai completed an interviewer-administered assessment, including questions about stigma, sexual risk, demographics, and psychosocial variables. More than one fifth of the MSM reported unprotected anal sex (UAS) in the past three months. Logistic regression procedures were used to examine correlates of having experienced stigma. The 11-item stigma scale had high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.99). Almost 2/5 (39%) reported a high-level of experienced stigma (≥ 12 mean scale-score) in their lifetime, and the mean stigma scale score was 12 (SD = 2.0). Significant correlates of having experienced prior stigma, after adjusting for age and educational attainment, included the following: identifying as a kothi (feminine acting/appearing and predominantly receptive in anal sex) compared to a panthi (masculine appearing, predominantly insertive) (AOR = 63.23; 95% CI: 15.92–251.14; p < 0.0001); being 'out' about one's MSM behavior (AOR = 5.63; 95% CI: 1.46–21.73; p = 0.01); having clinically significant depressive symptoms (AOR = 2.68; 95% CI: 1.40–5.12; p = 0.003); and engaging in sex work in the prior three months (AOR = 4.89; 95% CI: 2.51–9.51; p < 0.0001). These findings underscore the need to address psychosocial issues of Indian MSM. Unless issues such as stigma are addressed, effective HIV prevention interventions for this hidden population remain a challenge. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The numbers of attempts and performance scores were also documented for novices. The observed peer interaction modes consisted of guidance-tutoring, imitation, cooperation, and parallel activity. Multivariate and univariate analyses revealed that tutoring and imitation were manifested more in asymmetrical dyads, while cooperation and parallel activity were more frequent in symmetrical dyads. Males in symmetrical dyads displayed the most parallel activity. Males carried out more attempts than females. Regarding performance, males in asymmetrical dyads benefited more from training than the other groups did. Similarities and differences with findings observed in the academic domain are discussed.

Methods: An audio-computer-assisted survey was administered to a large, ethnically diverse sample of 526 YMSM (aged 18-24 years) recruited from bars, clubs, and other social venues using a venue-based probability sampling method. Results: Subjects reported a range of health and mental health problems, and involvement in health-compromising behaviors, such as overweight/obesity, depression, and suicidal thoughts/attempts, and many were found to have high rates of sexually transmitted infections. Moreover, many reported not having insurance coverage and/or limited access to care. Conclusions: Many of the health concerns and risks reported by these young men are preventable and can be addressed by any number of sectors, including health care and social service providers, religious organizations, schools, and employers.

Abstract = {Men who have sex with men and women (MSMW) are at high risk for HIV. However, the majority of research on populations of men who have sex with men (MSM) combines MSMW and men who have sex with men only (MSMO) samples, which limits our understanding of HIV risk behaviors and factors associated with HIV risk among MSMW populations. We used the BESURE-MSM2, a venue-based cross-sectional study of HIV risk behaviors among MSM in Baltimore, MD, to examine HIV risk among MSMW. MSMW were less likely to report unprotected receptive anal intercourse than MSMO (6.8% vs. 19.6%, p = .0024). Among MSMW, 43.0% reported unprotected sex with a woman in the past year, but only 19.4% reported unprotected sex with both men and women, representing only 5.0% of the total MSM sample. In multivariate analyses, we found that among MSMW having unprotected sex with women in the past year, disclosing same sex behavior and having a main female partner were associated with unprotected anal intercourse with male partners. HIV prevention programs for MSMW are needed that address the complex partnerships of MSMW and the social contextual factors within which relationships and behaviors are embedded.

Abstract = {Indian men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk for HIV compared to the general Indian population. Psychosocial factors may be uniquely associated with HIV risk among Indian MSM and may moderate the beneficial impact of standard HIV prevention approaches. Psychiatric diagnostic interviews and psychosocial and sexual risk assessments were conducted among 150 MSM in Mumbai, India. Logistic regression was employed to examine the association of psychiatric disorders and psychosocial problems to recent sexual risk behavior. Twenty-five percent of participants reported engaging in unprotected anal sex (UAS) during their last sexual contact with a man. Men who were married to a woman were more likely to have engaged in UAS during their last sexual contact with a man (35% vs. 17%, p = 0.018). In multivariable models, significant predictors of engaging in UAS were current major depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07, 6.39) and number of stressful life events (AOR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.83, 0.99). Alcohol dependence, anxiety, and self-esteem were not associated with engaging in UAS. Indian MSM with depression are at higher odds of engaging in UAS compared to MSM without depression. HIV prevention programs for Indian MSM may benefit from incorporating treatment or triage for mental health problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Studied a same-sex twin population in Copenhagen, born between 1950-1965. 47 twin pairs had a history of febrile convulsions (FC) in 1 member (14 were monozygotic, 32 dizogotic; each pair had grown up in the same home). Mean age at investigation was 12.6 yrs, ranging from 6-20. Using the healthy twins as controls, interviews with parents found the FC group not significantly different in behavior, nor did school reports find them markedly worse in scholastic achievement. Psychological testing with WISC or WAIS showed small but significantly poorer functioning in the FC group on memory, digit symbol, and black design subtests, and part B of the trail-making test.

Abstract = {Purpose: Young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) are known to have the highest rates of HIV infection in the United States. Although reported rates of unprotected anal intercourse are similar to the rates of men who have sex with men of other racial/ethnic backgrounds, YBMSM aged 15–22 years are five times more likely to be HIV-infected than the comparably aged white men who have sex with men. We explored contextual social-environmental factors that may influence how YBMSM assess risk, choose partners, and make decisions about condom use. Methods: We analyzed semi-structured interviews with 35 YBMSM (age: 18–24 years) in New York City, Upstate New York, and Atlanta. We used structured analytic coding based on a theoretical scheme that emerged from the data. Results: Perception of masculinity was the primary contextual factor influencing partner selection, risk assessment, and decision-making with regard to condom usage. Four primary themes emerged: (1) greater preference for partners perceived as masculine; (2) discomfort with allowing men perceived as feminine to be the insertive partner in anal intercourse; (3) a power dynamic such that partners perceived as more masculine made condom-use decisions within the dyad; and (4) use of potential partners’ perceived masculinity to assess HIV risk. Conclusions: Perceived masculinity may play a significant role in HIV risk for YBMSM and may be an important concept to consider in prevention strategies directed toward this population.

Abstract = {34 primary school teachers rated their 11-12-yr-old pupils on 25 personal characteristics chosen on their relevance to school behavior. Measures were also taken of pupil sociometric status, attendance, and IQ. Teacher selection was balanced for sex, women's marital status, age, and, social background. A correlation matrix was computed for each of the 68 single sex groups of pupils, then combined into 6 matrices and analyzed by the method of principal components, each yielding 6 factors which were then rotated by the varimax method. The 1st 3 rotated components accounted for 48-66% of the total variance and indicated 3 highly consistent dimensions of pupil assessment: 'good behavior,' 'high attainment,' and 'sociability and social leadership.'

Abstract = {In a design that combined assessment of short- and long-term stability, 175 boys and 159 girls in the 5th grade were met twice while they were in 5 elementary schools and 3 times after they had entered a single consolidated middle school. At each of these meetings, Ss were asked to nominate 3 same-sex best friends and 3 disliked same-sex peers and to nominate peers for 14 roles in a hypothetical class play. Although there was greater consistency in the Ss' choices of best friends than disliked peers, the stability of acceptance was roughly equal to the stability of rejection. Correction of the test–retest correlations for measurement error indicated that previous studies probably underestimated stability on these measures. Analysis of the association between sociometric measures and social reputation revealed possible causal links between social reputation and subsequent social preference and social impact as assessed by structural equation modeling techniques. No evidence indicated greater consistency of liked and disliked peer choices among girls than among boys, and popularity was only slightly related to consistency in friendship relations. Results indicate that by early adolescence sociometric standing appears to be a relatively stable phenomenon. The need for the assessment of qualitative aspects of friendship relations is stressed.

Abstract = {Short-term stability in adolescents' self-reported friendship networks was examined as a function of (1) participants' gender, (2) friendship status (best vs. secondary), (3) friendship gender composition (same sex vs. opposite sex), and (4) friendship contexts (school only vs. nonschool only vs. multiple). Adolescents (N = 102) took part in five monthly telephone interviews in which they nominated their friends and provided specific information for each of them. Results indicated that on average, one-third of participants' nominated friendships in their network were unstable over five months, with girls' perceived networks being more unstable than boys. Best friendship choices were more stable than secondary ones. Girls' reports of their opposite-sex friendships were more unstable than boys', and multicontext friendships (school and nonschool) were more stable than single-context friendships (school only or nonschool only). Results are discussed by highlighting the contribution of short-term assessments in understanding how adolescent networks change over time.

Abstract = {24 popular and 24 rejected Ss, including equal numbers from Grades 3 and 6, were paired with same-sex children in 2 ways. Ss were matched, in terms of achievement scores on a test of basic skills, with a child whom they had chosen as a friend and who had also chosen the target child as a friend on a sociometric questionnaire. They were also matched, using achievement scores, with a sociometrically defined amiable or neutral child (referred to as the nonfriend) whom the target Ss had neither selected nor rejected on their sociometric form. Ss were videotaped during a free-play task. Their conversations were transcribed and analyzed. Utterance density was significantly different between the sociometric status levels, with Ss defined as popular speaking more often than those defined as rejected. Physical proximity was significant for sex by grade, with 3rd-grade girls interacting more closely with each other than did any other group. Friends of target Ss touched them significantly more often than did nonfriends. Utterance patterns were examined, and utterance sequences significant for sociometric status and grade were noted.

Results indicated less popularity and greater rejection for LD students. Furthermore, a Group × Sex × Race interaction for negative nominations was found, indicating that White LD girls were most disliked of the LD group. It was suggested that greater dislike of White LD girls may be due to discrepancies between the achievement of LD children and their same-sex, same-race peers.

Abstract = {Crystal methamphetamine use is a major driver behind high-risk sexual behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM). Prior work suggests a cycle of continued crystal methamphetamine use and high-risk sex due to loss of the ability to enjoy other activities, which appears to be a side effect of this drug. Behavioral activation (BA) is a treatment for depression that involves learning to reengage in life's activities. We evaluated a novel intervention for crystal methamphetamine abuse and high-risk sex in MSM, incorporating 10 sessions of BA with integrated HIV risk reduction counseling (RR). Forty-four subjects were screened, of whom 21 met initial entry criteria. A total of 19 participants enrolled; 16 completed an open-phase study of the intervention. Behavioral assessments were conducted at baseline, 3 months postbaseline, and 6 months postbaseline. Linear mixed effects regression models were fit to assess change over time. Mean unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) episodes decreased significantly from baseline to acute postintervention (β = -4.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]= -7.48, -2.24; p = 0.0015) and from baseline to 6 months postbaseline (β = -5.07; 95% CI = -7.85, -2.29; p = 0.0017; test of fixed effects χ² = 16.59; df = 2,13; p = 0.0002). On average, there was a significant decrease over time in the number of crystal methamphetamine episodes in the past 3 months (χ² = 22.43; df =2,15; p < 0.0001), and the number of days of crystal methamphetamine use in the past 30 days (χ² = 9.21; df = 2,15; p = 0.010). Statistically significant reductions in depressive symptoms and poly-substance use were also maintained. Adding behavioral activation to risk reduction counseling for MSM with problematic crystal methamphetamine use may augment the potency of a risk reduction intervention for this population. Due to the small sample size and time intensive intervention, future testing in a randomized design is necessary to determine efficacy, with subsequent effectiveness testing.

Results show that high achievement was associated with greater popularity as a workmate at all 3 grade levels. Popularity as a playmate and as a best friend, however, was inversely related to achievement among 4th graders and unrelated to achievement among 8th graders. Findings suggest that high achievement may actually be a social liability among younger children choosing partners for social and athletic activities.

Prevalence estimates, mental health, and substance abuse behavior in MSM who were victims of CSA are examined. Results show a significant connection between CSA and the HIV risk behaviors of; (1) problems with social adjustment; (2) psychological disorders including anxiety, depression, and substance use; and (3) confusion about sexual identity. Methodological concerns include variation of the definition of CSA and the use of small convenience or clinical samples that may not be representative. Without longitudinal analysis it is challenging to determine the long-term negative outcomes related to the CSA experience.

Abstract = {India has the greatest number of HIV infections in Asia and the third highest total number of infected persons globally. Men who have sex with men (MSM) are considered by the Government of India's National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) a 'core risk group' for HIV in need of HIV prevention efforts. However there is a dearth of information on the frequency of participation in HIV prevention interventions and subsequent HIV risk and other correlates among MSM in India. Recruited through peer outreach workers, word of mouth and snowball sampling techniques, 210 MSM in Chennai completed an interviewer-administered assessment, including questions about participating in any HIV prevention interventions in the past year, sexual risk taking, demographics, MSM identities, and other psychosocial variables. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to examine behavioral and demographic correlates with HIV prevention intervention participation. More than a quarter (26%) of the sample reported participating in an HIV prevention intervention in the year prior to study participation. Participants who reported engaging in unprotected anal sex (UAS; odds ratio [OR] = 0.28; p = 0.01) in the 3 months prior to study enrollment were less likely to have participated in an HIV prevention program in the past year. MSM who were older (OR = 1.04; p = 0.05), kothis (feminine acting/appearing and predominantly receptive partners in anal sex) compared to panthis (masculine appearing, predominantly insertive partners; OR = 5.52, p = 0.0004), those with higher educational attainment (OR = 1.48, p = 0.01), being 'out' about having sex with other men (OR = 4.03, p = 0.0001), and MSM who reported ever having been paid in exchange for sex (OR = 2.92, p = 0.001) were more likely to have reported participation in an HIV prevention intervention in the preceding year. In a multivariable model, MSM reporting UAS in the prior 3 months were less likely to have participated in an HIV prevention intervention (AOR = 0.34, p = 0.04). MSM who were older (AOR = 1.05, p = 0.05), those with higher educational attainment (AOR = 1.92, p = 0.0009), and MSM who were 'out' about having sex with other men (AOR = 2.71, p = 0.04) were more likely to have reported participating in an HIV prevention program. Findings suggest that exposure to HIV prevention interventions may be protective against engaging in UAS for some MSM in India. Understanding predictors of participation in an HIV prevention intervention is helpful for identifying Indian MSM who might have had no exposure to HIV prevention information and skills building, hence allowing researchers and prevention workers to focus efforts on individuals at greatest need.

Abstract = {Explores the prezygotic hypothesis, which considers the possibility that development is subject to environmental influences on the oocyte prior to conception. Such influences may occur in the maternal grandmother's uterus where oogenesis is completed or in the mother before fertilization. According to this hypothesis, the separate eggs from which dizygotic (DZ) twins are derived may be sensitive to microenvironmental variations within an ovary. As a first approach, the authors examined 514 same-sex monozygotic (MZ) and 336 DZ twin pairs (high school students) for maternal age effects on differences between pairs in cognitive and behavioral traits. While no differences between MZ and DZ pairs were found that would indicate a major effect of the prezygotic environment, suggestions are made for further experimental studies of this unexplored question in human development.

Abstract = {Objectives: We compared social network characteristics of African American men who have sex with men only (MSMO) with social network characteristics of African American men who have sex with men and women (MSMW). Methods: Study participants were 234 African American men who have sex with men who completed a baseline social network assessment for a pilot behavioral HIV prevention intervention in Baltimore, Maryland, from 2006 through 2009. We surveyed the men to elicit the characteristics of their social networks, and we used logistic regression models to assess differences in network characteristics. Results: MSMO were significantly more likely than were MSMW to be HIVpositive (52% vs 31%). We found no differences between MSMO and MSMW in the size of kin networks or emotional and material support networks.MSMWhad denser sexual networks, reported more concurrent and exchange partners, used condoms with more sexual partners, and reported interaction with a larger number of sexual partners at least once a week. Conclusions: Although there were many similarities in the social and sexual network characteristics of MSMO and MSMW, differences did exist. HIV prevention interventions should address the unique needs of African American MSMW. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objective: To explore compliance with the UK blood services’ criterion that excludes men who have had penetrative sex with a man from donating blood, and to assess the possible effects of revising this policy. Design: A random location, cross sectional survey followed by qualitative interviews. Setting: Britain. Participants: 1028 of 32 373 men in the general population reporting any male sexual contact completed the survey. Additional questions were asked of a general population sample (n=3914). Thirty men who had had penetrative sex with a man participated in the qualitative interviews (19 who had complied with the blood services’ exclusion criterion and 11 who had not complied). Main outcome measure: Compliance with the blood services’ lifetime exclusion criterion for men who have had penetrative sex with a man. Results: 10.6% of men with experience of penetrative sex with a man reported having donated blood in Britain while ineligible under the exclusion criterion, and 2.5% had donated in the previous 12 months. Ineligible donation was less common among men who had had penetrative sex with a man recently (in previous 12 months) than among men for whom this last occurred longer ago. Reasons for non-compliance with the exclusion included self categorisation as low risk, discounting the sexual experience that barred donation, belief in the infallibility of blood screening, concerns about confidentiality, and misunderstanding or perceived inequity of the rule. Although blood donation was rarely viewed as a 'right,' potential donors were seen as entitled to a considered assessment of risk. A one year deferral since last male penetrative sex was considered by study participants to be generally feasible, equitable, and acceptable. Conclusions: A minority of men who have sex with men who are ineligible to donate blood under the current donor exclusion in Britain have nevertheless done so in the past 12 months. Many of the reasons. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Comments on an article by P. Ueda et al. (see record [rid]2014-28847-001[/rid]). Ueda et al. reported the lack of association between neonatal vitamin D status and MS risk in a large case–control study based on the Swedish Phenylketonuria Register, a bio bank containing dried blood spots (DBS) collected from virtually all newborns in Sweden since 1975. This investigation addressed the following question: given 2 groups of children of the same sex and born in the same month and year, do those with the highest blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels at birth have a lower MS risk than those with the lowest levels? Strengths of the study include the relatively large sample size which provides sufficient power to detect moderate to strong associations between neonatal vitamin D status and MS risk, and the use of a previously validated high-performance liquid chromatography assay to measure 25(OH)D levels in DBS. The relevance of in utero exposure to inadequate vitamin D to MS risk has strong appeal, but little empirical support. Although the results of the current study, the first based on measurement of blood levels of 25(OH)D at birth, do not support the hypothesis that in utero or neonatal vitamin D concentrations are a strong determinant of MS, they are far from conclusive. Studies relying on better-preserved samples collected at birth or during pregnancy, and including populations with a broader range of vitamin D levels are needed to guide sound, evidence-based public health and clinical recommendations regarding vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy for MS prevention.

Abstract = {Conducted 2 experiments to determine how initial task experiences of success and failure combine with observation of task outcomes of same-age, same-sex peers to affect the achievement expectations of 2nd and 3rd graders. Ss were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: The problems were solvable (success) or unsolvable (failure), or there were no problems (no feedback). Results of both experiments, the 1st with 75 lower-class urban Black children, and the 2nd with 75 middle-class rural White children, show that Ss' expectations were increased by their own success and the observed success of peers and were lowered by both direct and vicarious failure. However, Black and White Ss differed in their response to conditions that were designed to determine the relative influence of Black vs White comparison others. Lower-class Black Ss were more influenced by same-race comparison others only after a relatively unexpected initial outcome (failure for boys and success for girls), whereas middle-class White Ss showed a tendency to be more influenced by same-race others, regardless of their prior task experience. Achievement motivation and differential familiarity with other-race children are offered as possible explanations for this difference.

An ethnically mixed sample of 120 fourth-grade children (60 boys, 60 girls, mean age = 9 years, 4 months) observed either one or three same-sex peers learn to solve fraction problems. Mastery models easily grasped fraction operations and verbalized positive achievement beliefs. Coping-emotive models initially experienced difficulties learning and verbalized negative emotive statements, after which they displayed coping behaviors and eventually performed as well as mastery models. Coping-alone models performed in identical fashion to coping-emotive models but never verbalized negative achievement beliefs. Coping-emotive models led to the highest self-efficacy for learning. Mastery and coping-alone subjects perceived the model as competent and themselves as equally competent, whereas coping-emotive subjects viewed themselves as more competent than the model. No differences were obtained due to number of models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Objectives: To determine HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence, trends, and risk behaviors of men who have sex with men (MSM) and compare these with those of non-MSM attending STI clinics in Pune, India over a 10-year period. Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: From 1993 through 2002, men attending 3 STI clinics in Pune underwent HIV/STI screening. Demographic, risk behavior, clinical, and laboratory data were collected using standardized questionnaires and laboratory procedures. Results: Of 10,785 men screened, 708 (6.6%) were MSM. Among these 708 MSM, 189 (31.7%) had 10 or more lifetime partners, 253 (35.7%) were married, 163 (23.1%) had sex with a hijra (eunuch), and 87 (13.3%) had exchanged money for sex. A total of 134 (18.9%) were HIV-positive, 149 (21.5%) had genital ulcer disease (GUD), 37 (5.8%) had syphilis, and 29 (4.3%) had gonorrhea (GC). Over the decade, neither HIV nor GC prevalence changed among MSM (P = 0.7), but syphilis and GUD decreased significantly (P < 0.0001). Compared with non-MSM, MSM were more likely to initiate sexual activity at age <16 years, to have >10 lifetime partners, to have sex with a hijra, and to use condoms regularly, but they did not differ significantly in HIV prevalence and had a lower prevalence of GC, GUD, and syphilis. Independent factors associated with HIV among MSM were employment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.08; P = 0.02), history of GUD (AOR = 1.86; P = 0.003), and syphilis (AOR = 2.09; P = 0.05). Conclusions: Same-sex and high-risk sexual behaviors are prevalent among men attending STI clinics in India. Although syphilis and GUD rates decreased, HIV prevalence remained high during the decade, highlighting the importance of additional targeted efforts to reduce HIV risk among all men, including MSM, in India.

Heavy alcohol consumption is associated with increased sexual risk-taking behaviours in many cultures, in particular among MSM. However, no studies to date have explored alcohol use and HIV risk among MSM in India. MSM in Chennai, India (n = 210) completed an interviewer-administered behavioural and psychosocial assessment. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression procedures examined behavioural and demographic associations with weekly alcohol consumption. Twenty-eight percent of the sample (n = 58) reported using alcohol at least weekly to the point of being buzzed/intoxicated, which was associated with older age, being married to a woman, being panthi (masculine appearing, predominantly insertive partners) versus kothi (feminine acting/appearing and predominantly receptive partners), weekly tobacco use, unprotected anal sex and unprotected vaginal sex in the three months prior to study enrolment (all P < 0.05). In a multivariable model, unprotected vaginal sex in the previous three months and being married to a women were unique variables associated with weekly alcohol use (all P < 0.01). Further investigation of alcohol use within the context of sexual risk taking is warranted among Indian MSM. Panthis and MSM who are married to women may be particularly likely to benefit from interventions to decrease alcohol intake and concurrent unsafe sex.

Multivariate analyses were applied to parental and teacher ratings from an investigator-based interview, the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, and three questionnaires (the Child Behavior Checklist and the Rutter Parent and Teacher Scales. Results from patterns of intercorrelations and factor analyses of maternal measures suggest that at the phenotypic level, these assessed the same underlying behavioural construct, which differed from other emotional and behavioural constructs. However, genetic analyses showed that in addition to a common factor underlying the expression of ADHD as assessed across the range of measures, additional genetic factors were identified that were method- and rater-specific. Findings suggest that although the investigator-based interview and the behavioural checklists tap similar aspects of ADHD behavior, there is additional rater-specific variance.

Abstract = {The frontispiece of the Blacky Pictures was projected to groups of junior and senior high school students; stories were obtained from 72 males and 64 females. A comparable slide of 'Whitey the cat' provided the stimulus for stories from an additional 71 male and 71 female students. Identification responses were assumed to occur when a S referred to a sexually ambiguous, cartoon character as being of the same sex as the S. When this operational definition of identification was employed, female S did not identify more with 'Whitey the cat' than with 'Blacky the dog;' in fact, over 95% of the female Ss referred to the main character as masculine regardless of which stimulus was presented. Male and female responses were essentially indistinguishable. There was no significant difference between male and female Ss in identifying the cartoon sibling as female. The results are interpreted in terms of linguistic and other socio-cultural determinants rather than in terms of psychodynamic factors.

Abstract = {Performed hierarchical factor analyses involving Schmid-Leiman transformations on data collected from 148 identical and 135 same-sex fraternal elementary school-aged twin pairs. 17 measures of specific cognitive abilities grouped into 2 test batteries were measured. Individual differences in specific cognitive abilities were influenced by both genetic influences that are common across all of the measures (i.e., genetic g) and by genetic influences that are specific to group factors. Common shared environmental influences (i.e., shared environmental g) seemed to be less important than the common genetic factor for the Specific Cognitive Abilities Battery, but equally important for the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children—Revised (WISC—R). Genetic factors were more influential than environmental factors in structuring individual differences. Findings for genetic influences replicate those of L. R. Cardon et al (see record [rid]1993-40802-001[/rid]), but the role of shared family environment is much more pronounced. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Examined the risk of psychiatric disorders among 5,877 individuals with same-sex sexual partners (aged 15–54 yrs). Data were obtained from a nationally representative household survey. Respondents were asked the number of women and men with whom they had sexual intercourse in the past 5 yrs. Results show that a total of 2.1% of men and 1.5% of women reported 1 or more same-sex sexual partners in the past 5 yrs. These respondents had higher 12-mo prevalences of anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders and of suicidal thoughts and plans than did respondents with opposite-sex partners only. The elevated same-sex 12-mo prevalences were largely due to higher lifetime prevalences. Ages at onset and persistence of disorders did not differ between the same-sex and opposite-sex subsamples.

Abstract = {Examined (1) whether group decisions are riskier (indicating a higher aspiration level) than those made by individuals, and (2) whether group and individual performance level depends on the type of task. 1,200 elementary and secondary school students (aged 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 yrs) were tested individually or in same-sex groups on 5 tasks: arithmetic tests, target-throwing, maze tracing, puzzles, and bead stringing. Each type of task had 5 difficulty levels. In all task situations, groups made riskier decisions than individuals, indicating the former's higher aspiration level. There was a pronounced discrepancy between aspiration and achievement levels both in groups and in individuals. Findings confirm that task type significantly affects aspiration level and—to a greater extent—achievement level. (19 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Investigated the family environment and the temperament of children with Down's syndrome (DS). Parents of 40 children (aged 4–16 yrs) with DS completed the Family Environmental Scale (FES). They also filled out the Temperament Assessment Battery for Children (TABC) for both the child with DS and the nearest same-sex sibling. A similar questionnaire of the TABC (teacher form) was sent to the children's teachers. There were high scores in categories of cohesion, expressiveness, achievement, moral/religious emphasis, organization, and control on the FES, indicating that family members in the study cohort are relationship oriented, provide support for one another, emphasize ethical values, and are able to express their feelings. Control children scored higher in the adaptability and persistence categories of the TABC, whereas children with DS achieved significantly higher scores in the approach/withdrawal category.

Abstract = {When the ten children to be studied were originally selected, differences in physical types and the motor aspects of behavior were not considered. At that time we would not have predicted the wide range of physical and motor differences that actually existed among these ten children so close in age and background-wide differences even between members of the same sex: how different Margaret's slow, large movements from Amy's short, quick ones; Allison's immobility of feature from Carol's expressive changes of countenance; Dick's vigorous puppy-like motility from Mark's calm restraint of movement. The questions remain: What did these children have in common as a group in postural habits, physical expressiveness or skills requiring refined coordinations? Were these common characteristics a function of their level of development? How much were they influenced by the quality of their immediate situation? This chapter describes these differences using findings from descriptive records in school situations and from check records during group singing and story reading.

Abstract = {Men who have sex with men (MSM) in India are a hidden population, facing unique environmental stressors and cultural pressures that place them at risk for depression. Depression may affect HIV risk behavior in MSM, and may affect the degree to which MSM may benefit from HIV prevention interventions. Depression in MSM in India, however, has largely been understudied. Two hundred ten MSM in Chennai completed an interviewer-administered behavioral assessment battery, which included the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), demographics, sexual risk and identity, and other psychosocial variables. Over half (55%) of the sample exceeded the cutoff (CES-D ≥ 16) to screen in for clinically significant depressive symptoms; this was associated with having had unprotected anal sex (OR = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.01–3.87) and higher number of male partners (OR = 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01–1.07). Statistically significant bivariate predictors of meeting the screen in for depressive symptoms included sexual identity (Kothi > Panthi; OR = 4.90; 95% CI: 2.30–10.54), not being married (OR = 3.40; 95% CI: 1.72–6.81), not having a child (OR = 4.40; 95% CI: 2.07–9.39), family not knowing about one's MSM identity (OR = 2.30; 95% CI: 1.18–4.90), having been paid for sex (OR = 5.10; p 95% CI: 2.87–9.47), and perceiving that one is at risk for acquiring HIV (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.02–1.17; continuous). In a multivariable logistic-regression model, unique predictors of screening in for depressive symptoms included not being married (AOR = 3.10; 95% CI: 1.23–7.65), having been paid for sex (AOR = 3.80; 95% CI: 1.87–7.99) and the perception of increased risk for HIV (AOR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.03–1.21; continuous); unprotected anal sex in the 3 months prior to study enrollment approached statistical significance (AOR = 2.00; 95% CI: 0.91–4.48). Depression among MSM in Chennai is of concern and should be considered while developing HIV prevention interventions with this population. MSM who are not married, sex workers, and those who perceive they are at risk for acquiring HIV may be of higher risk for symptoms of depression.

Abstract = {In India men who have sex with men (MSM) are stigmatized, understudied, and at high risk for HIV. Understanding the impact of psychosocial issues on HIV risk behavior and HIV infection can help shape culturally relevant HIV prevention interventions. Peer outreach workers recruited 210 MSM in Chennai who completed an interviewer-administered psychosocial assessment battery and underwent HIV testing and counseling. More than one fifth (46/210) reported unprotected anal intercourse in the past 3 months, 8% tested positive for HIV, and 26% had previously participated in an HIV prevention intervention. In a multivariable logistic-regression model controlling for age, MSM subpopulation (kothi, panthi, or double-decker), marital status, and religion, significant predictors of any unprotected anal intercourse were being less educated (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = .54; p = .009), not having previously participated in an HIV prevention program (AOR = 3.75; p = .05), having clinically significant depression symptoms (AOR = 2.8; p = .02), and lower self-efficacy (AOR = .40; p < .0001). Significant predictors of testing positive for HIV infection were: being less educated (AOR = .53; .05) and not currently living with parent(s) (AOR = 3.71; p = .05). Given the prevalence of HIV among MSM, efforts to reach hidden subpopulations of MSM in India are still needed. Such programs for MSM in India may need to address culturally-relevant commonly co-occurring psychosocial problems to maximize chances of reducing risk for infection.

Abstract = {In view of the current interest in children's peer relationships and social skills and the need for valid assessment procedures for children's peer problems, the present study examined the correspondence between peer ratings of acceptance (PRAs) and teacher ratings of a child's social behavior and likability. Ss were 48 males and 44 females from the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades. Classroom teachers rated each child on withdrawn, aggressive, and likable behaviors using the Pupil Evaluation Inventory. Peer ratings of the child's acceptance in play and work situations were obtained from same-sex classmates. Teacher ratings of likability were the best predictors of peer acceptance scores for males; withdrawn behavior was the best predictor of peer acceptance scores for females. Ratings of withdrawn and aggressive behavior contributed to the prediction of peer acceptance scores for males; for females, only withdrawn behavior contributed to the prediction of peer acceptance. In terms of the clinical utility of teacher ratings for assessing children with peer problems, the use of the withdrawn and/or aggressive ratings scales appeared to offer a promise as a means of identifying such children.

Abstract = {Objectives: We examined risk behaviors of female drug users, comparing those who reported recently having had sex with women (recent WSW), those who reported previously having had sex with women (former WSW), and those who reported never having had sex with women (never WSW). Methods: We used data from the Risk Evaluation and Assessment of Community Health III Study. Adjusted odds for predictors of WSW status were determined via multinomial logistic regression analyses. Results: Of the participants, 75% were never WSW, 12% were former WSW, and 13% were recent WSW. In comparison with never WSW status, significant predictors of recent WSW status were living away from one's parents as a child (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07,8.67) and recently having been paid for sex by men (adjusted OR = 4.02; 95% CI = 1.67,9.68). Also, recently having been paid for sex by men was a significant predictor of former WSW status as opposed to never WSW status (adjusted OR = 3.97; 95% CI = 1.65, 9.59). Conclusions: The recency with which they had sex with women is one of the facets influencing the risk profile of WSW. The diverse characteristics of the WSW population need to be incorporated into future studies and risk interventions targeting this group.

In their own view and that of their teachers, children who did not smoke were academically better than smokers. Children who smoked were more likely than nonsmokers to have a parent and siblings of the same sex who smoked. No association was found between the child's own smoking and that of parents and siblings of the opposite sex. Smokers were more likely to have friends who smoked. Most children did not think smoking was enjoyable or desirable and many thought it bad for health, irrespective of their own smoking habits. The majority thought people of their own age smoked to show off. (19 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Ladd's (see record [rid]1981-13280-001[/rid]) investigation on the effectiveness of the social learning method for increasing social interactive behavior of 'mildly' withdrawn/isolated children with their peers. There were 2 differences between studies: Ss used in the present study were 30 'severely' withdrawn/isolated children, and the training sessions, unlike Ladd's fixed time schedule, continued until the S's level of performance reached the level of average peers in each targeted social skill. 10 Ss in the experimental condition were paired with same-sex peers of average sociometric rating and coached on specific social skills during 3 45-min training sessions per week. 10 Ss in an attention control condition were paired with same-sex peers, and this dyad played games with 2 randomly selected peers. 10 Ss were in a nontreatment control condition. Results indicate that the social learning method used in the experimental condition increased social interaction of the severely withdrawn/isolated Ss with their peers. However, increasing their rate of behavior in targeted social skills to the level of performance of their average peers required approximately 4 times as many sessions of training as Ladd conducted with mildly withdrawn/isolated children.

Abstract = {Examined age and genetic effects on Spontaneous Selective Attention Task (SSAT) performance in normal children in order to evaluate whether the SSAT has the potential to qualify as a candidate endophenotype for schizophrenia in studies of at-risk children. A total of 59 monozygotic twin pairs and 33 same-sex dizygotic twin pairs (all Ss aged 10–18 yrs) were tested on the SSAT, a Continuous Performance Test (CPT), a Span of Apprehension Test (SPAN), and a full-scale IQ test. Baseline performance on the SSAT, which was correlated with verbal IQ and SPAN performance, improved with age but showed no significant heritability. The P/N ratio of selective attention was stable over the 10–18 yr age range, was not significantly correlated with IQ, CPT, or SPAN performance, and its heritability was estimated to be 0.41. These findings suggest that the P/N selectivity ratio measured by the SSAT may be useful as a vulnerability marker in studies of children born into families segregating schizophrenia.

Abstract = {HIV disclosure among sexually active HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) is a complex phenomenon. To better understand factors that impact the decision-making process regarding HIV disclosure among HIV-infected MSM, the present study analyzed content from previously conducted counseling sessions where HIV disclosure was selected as the primary focus of the session. The counselor/participant dialogue was audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed qualitatively using content analysis. Factors identified as barriers that deter HIV-infected MSM from disclosing include rejection, issues of confidentiality, possible missed sexual opportunities, partner’s HIV status, deferred responsibility, sexual partner type, and public sex environments. Participants identified ethical obligation, the potential for a dating relationship, timing of disclosure, and bidirectional communication as facilitators of disclosure. Findings can be used for policy development as well as to guide social workers and other healthcare providers’ assessment and development of clinical interventions addressing sexual health among HIV-infected MSM as it relates to HIV disclosure.

Ss were 15 5th graders in 2 same-sex groups. The goals of the program were to increase the children's interpersonal understanding, problem-solving skills, and ability to identify and express their own feelings. Informal discussions, bibliotherapy, and drawing exercises preceded the development of the filmstrip. This concrete task allowed children to transform feelings of powerlessness over family breakup into the pleasure of achievement and increased self-esteem. The project also led to more open communication between parents and children. This model is recommended as a counseling process.

Abstract = {Following a theoretical analysis of factors which foster interpersonal cooperation, conditions conducive to school children's working together harmoniously and productively were studied. 76 same-sex triads of 4th and 5th graders were asked to cooperate in making a block picture on a round board. Five conditions were created, varying in patterns of interdependence. All conditions included goal interdependence, but differed systematically in the presence of task requirements, task roles, and group roles. Behavior was prerecorded into various group- and individual-oriented categories, and an index of quality of performance was constructed. As hypothesized, while goal interdependence was sufficient to bring about friendly interactions, it did not maximize occurrence of group oriented behavior. Ss worked together most, and performance was significantly better, under conditions where task requirements, task roles, and group roles were present together. A strong consistent pattern of sex differences was found, with boys showing greater independence from experimental role inductions than did the girls, whose cooperative work pattern and performance increased systematically as their interdependence was strengthened in the 5 conditions. Implications for instructional practice are examined. (20 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to test 3 of Hollingshead's hypotheses: (a) social class and intelligence are closely related, (b) social class and achievement in schools are closely related, and (c) same-sex adolescent friendship groupings closely follow class lines. A random sample of 51 same-sex friendships totaling 151 Ss was selected from a high school student body of 2500 in southern California. In addition, another 125 Ss were selected in the same school from the junior high. Class criterion was determined by occupations of the fathers. The conclusions drawn from the correlation found were that social class was of little importance in the above hypothesis. The Elmtown finding by Hollingshead did not obtain because the community was new or a biased population from within each social class may have been drawn to live in that community, and the relationship between status and behavior does not appear.

Abstract = {170 9th graders completed a modification of the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List, 2 measures of self-esteem, and an inventory based on the Perceptual Preference section of the Learning Style Questionnaire. 10 factors were required to account for the variance of self-described preferred learning styles, in contrast to R. Dunn and K. Dunn's (1975) 4 factors. High achieving Ss had greater preferences for learning through reading, and both high and low achievers had greater preferences for learning through visual demonstration than moderate achievers. Males showed a greater preference for manipulative activity, while females tended to prefer teacher explanation. Few correlations between self-esteem and preferred learning styles were significant, although low self-esteem Ss tended to have learning styles slightly different from their same-sex peers.

Of the 16% of participants who were infected with HIV, nearly all were unaware of their infection. Few reported testing frequently for HIV, and many reported engaging in behaviors that could transmit HIV because they perceived themselves or their partners to be at low risk for infection.

Abstract = {Recent studies of homosexual people have found higher rates of nonfatal suicidal behavior than among heterosexuals. The purpose of this study was to determine associations between self-harm and sexual orientation for men and women separately, defining sexual orientation by sexual attraction rather than by behavior. In a birth cohort of 1,019 New Zealand young adults eligible to be interviewed at age 26 years, 946 participated in assessments of both sexual attraction and self-harm. Both women and men who had experienced same-sex attraction had higher risks of self-harm. The odds ratios for suicidal ideation in the past year were 3.1 for men and 2.9 for women. Odds ratios for ever having deliberately self-harmed were 5.5 for men and 1.9 for women. Men with same-sex attraction were also significantly more likely to report having attempted suicide. In both sexes, a greater degree of same-sex attraction predicted increasing likelihood of self-harm, with over one-third of men and women with persistent major same-sex attraction reporting this. Men with even a minor degree of same-sex attraction had high rates of self-harm and resulting physical injury. One-quarter of deliberate self-harm among men and one-sixth among women was potentially attributable to same-sex attraction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Describes the significant role of community members during the intervention development phase of a randomized clinical trial of an HIV prevention intervention (Project Connect) for low-income, high-risk African American and Latina women and their main sexual partners. 16 women and 13 male partners were engaged as 'consultants' in a series of focus group discussions aimed at exploring their reactions and ideas about potential topics and approaches for the intervention. Each individual participated in 3 focus groups—2 single-sex groups and a 3rd group that brought women and their male partners together. Focus group data extended the authors knowledge about the impact of relationship dynamics on safer sex negotiation and allowed them to design an intervention that is contextually specific and pragmatic. Target community members can provide critical input during the intervention development process and should be recognized as viable and meaningful collaborators in all phases of intervention research.

Martin et al; see record [rid]1986-19473-001[/rid]). Principal components analysis identified 2 orthogonal factors. The 1st factor was strongly associated with increased body sway, self-rated intoxication and unwillingness to drive, and reported low average weekly alcohol consumption, but showed a very weak association with blood alcohol concentration. The 2nd factor had high loadings on tests assessing psychomotor coordination, was strongly associated with blood alcohol concentration, but was unrelated to willingness to drive or self-rated intoxication. Multivariate genetic analysis indicated independent genetic and environmental determination of differences in sensitivity to the effects of alcohol on these factors.

Abstract = {Examined whether children at risk for the development of adult alcohol dependence would show greater 'behavioral inhibition' to the unfamiliar, an early childhood temperament characteristic. 100 peer play evaluations were conducted blindly with 36 preschool children (aged 4–6 yrs) from families selected to be at high or low risk for developing alcohol dependence. Each child was paired with different children (same-sex pairs) in independent sessions to determine the stability of the behavioral response. Results show that high-risk children spent significantly more time staring at the other child during the peer play session while refraining from engaging in play, and significantly less time speaking to the other child. Significantly more time was spent proximal to the parent, but only on the first peer play session. These behaviors have been shown to be indicators of behavioral inhibition. Findings suggest that the presence of behavioral inhibition to the unfamiliar in childhood may be a risk factor for later development of alcohol dependence. The present results suggest that internalizing behaviors, like externalizing behaviors, may be a pathway for the development of substance dependence. A comment by N. Z. Weinberg is appended to the article. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

A social interaction self-statement test served as the cognitive measure. Physiological reactivity was monitored continuously throughout Ss' completion of the following behavioral tasks: an unstructured interpersonal interaction with an opposite-sex confederate, a similar interaction with a same-sex confederate, and an impromptu talk on a topic selected by the S. The clinic and nonclinic samples of SA Ss differed significantly from the NSA Ss in level of physiological reactivity and type of cognition. There were no significant differences between the 2 anxious groups. The results indicate that both thoughts and physiological reactivity were influenced by situational parameters.

Abstract = {Investigated the lifetime prevalence rates of childhood sexual abuse, involvement in juvenile prostitution, and adult sexual assault in a sample of 358 homosexual and bisexual males (aged 19-35 yrs). Questionnaire data indicate that almost 1 in 10 of the men had engaged in juvenile prostitution, 14% were forced into sexual activity before 14 yrs of age, and 14% were sexually victimized after the age of 14. Those exposed to nonconsensual sex were 2.9 times more likely to abuse alcohol than those free of victimization. Those who reported childhood sexual abuse were 3.3 times more likely to have attempted suicide. Juvenile prostitution was associated with current depression. The authors state that health professionals have the responsibility to respond competently and sensitively to victims of sexual violence. To do this, many need to recognize the prevalence of male sexual trauma, to deconstruct their personal beliefs about same-sex sexual violence, and to learn to ask sensitive questions in their assessment interviews.

Abstract = {Background: The social networks of people with mental illness have received much attention, but users of day care services have rarely been considered. Methods: Users of day hospitals and day centres were surveyed cross-sectionally. Demographic and illness factors were tested for associations with network size, while intrinsic relationship factors were tested for association with confiding in a network member. Results: There was some evidence that a longer duration of contact with services, more unmet needs, working, living in supported accommodation and needing help with psychotic symptoms were associated with having a larger network, while a longer duration of contact was associated with having more confidantes. Day centre users confided in people who were more likely to be friends or neighbours than professionals, and who were more likely to be the same sex. Conclusion: For people in day care, the stereotype that people with longer-term mental health problems are socially isolated is contradicted by this study. The limited role of professionals in providing confiding relationships is striking. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {A study of 55 women and 61 men (aged 18–68 yrs) examined the relationships among S's sex, experimenter sex, sex roles, and sexual attitudes as predictors of drawing the same sex figure on the Draw A Person test. Results indicate that S and experimenter sex are consistent and significant predictors of picture sex. Most Ss drew a same-sex figure first as opposed to an opposite-sex figure. Results also show that male Ss were more likely to draw an opposite-sex female figure than female Ss were to draw an opposite-sex male figure. Masculinity and sexual attitudes also predicted figure sex, but only for female picture attributes. The authors suggest that Ss' response to current, historically determined attitudes toward gender and gender roles must be seen as strong influences on the sex of the drawn picture.

Abstract = {Examined lifetime and recent prevalence and correlates of and gender differences in the sexual risk behaviors of 156 gay, lesbian, and bisexual youths (aged 14–21 yrs) from gay-focused organizations in New York City. Ss completed measures including the Sexual Risk Assessment Schedule—Youth, the Health Inventory for Adolescents, and the Social-Desirability Scale. Data indicate 7 reasons why the Ss are at risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases: Ss initiated sex during early adolescence, Ss' 1st sexual partners were older than they were, HIV barrier methods (e.g., condoms) were initiated subsequent to sexual debut, many lifetime sexual partners and encounters were reported, some Ss exchanged sex for goods, many Ss reported having had at least 1 partner at risk for HIV, and the Ss had engaged in unprotected sexual behaviors during the past 3 mo. Significant gender differences emerged (e.g., male Ss reported more lifetime same-sex partners than female Ss and female Ss reported more lifetime other-sex partners than male Ss). Recent sexual risk behaviors (i.e., numbers of same-sex partners, encounters, and unprotected sex during the past 3 mo) were related significantly to the Ss' average degree of emotional involvement in or average duration of intimate relationships.

Abstract = {Extended previous research on the phenomenology of childhood homesickness by assessing a sample of 316 boys (aged 8–16 yrs) who were spending 2 wks at a single-sex residential summer camp. Some 18% of Ss reported moderate or high levels of homesickness; 7% reported concomitant severe depressive and anxious symptoms. Homesickness intensity was negatively correlated with separation experience and age. It was most commonly associated with depressive symptoms and internalizing behavior problems. For severely homesick Ss, intensity increased over time, decreasing just prior to their return home. Preseparation assessment suggested that severely homesick Ss had elevated levels of homesickness and negative emotions months before arriving at camp. One year follow-up data suggested that the intensity of severe homesickness decreased with age and experience. However, severely homesick Ss were less likely than other Ss to return to camp. The results demonstrate how brief separations can affect children's well-being and attitudes about separations. Severe homesickness is distinct from separation anxiety disorder, but has elements of this and other psychopathologies. Theories of negative emotion, attachment, and coping complement emerging theories of homesickness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Administered the California Reading Achievement Test to 70 pairs of 9-12 yr old same-sex twins. Intraclass (within-pair) correlations were significantly higher for monozygotic (MZ) than for dizygotic (DZ) pairs, and F ratios of variance showed that the DZ pairs had significantly greater within-pair variability than the MZ pairs. Results are in close agreement with findings of previous studies, and together are indicative of hereditary influences in reading achievement. The MZ twins' reading scores were found in a bimodal rather than a normal distribution, suggesting a recessive gene influence on relatively lower reading scores. Tentative support for this suggestion was found by comparing the observed distribution with that expected from a recessive gene model. The advantages are discussed for utilizing twin samples for further research into (a) inherited underlying traits which might influence reading achievement and (b) environmental contributions to reading achievement.

Abstract = {36 male and 36 female 3rd–4th graders, 39 male and 36 female 7th–8th graders, and 39 male and 36 female 11th–12th graders were given a description of a same-sex child who was either nonhandicapped, physically handicapped, or mentally retarded and who was academically and socially competent or incompetent. Developmental differences in reactions to handicapped children were assessed through measures of attributions for performance, trait perceptions, and expectations for future success. Attributional measures revealed little except an increase in internal attributions with age, especially among girls. While young Ss stigmatized both physically handicapped and mentally retarded incompetent children under some circumstances, older Ss leaned toward favoring the incompetent and handicapped children, although high school Ss also tended to derogate a competent retarded child. Young boys were pessimistic about the future of the physically handicapped child, and young girls about the future of the retarded child; 7th–8th graders did not differentiate among handicap statuses; and 11th–22th graders were pessimistic only about the retarded child. These developmental shifts took place in a context in which behavioral competence exerted far more influence on evaluative reactions than did handicap status.

Included in the sample were 39 adolescent twins, allowing assessment for possible genetic effects underlying the P50 sensory gating phenotype, by comparison of the similarity of the measure in monozygotic (MZ) and same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. The MZ twins had significantly higher similarity for the P50 ratio within each twin pair than the DZ twins.

To control for variation in level of attention, a match/mismatch CNV paradigm was used in which a 2nd slide (S2) was either identical to or different from the 1st slide. Ss were required to indicate a same/different judgment by button pressing at S2 offset. CNV in anticipation of opposite sex nudes was of significantly greater amplitude than CNV in anticipation of same sex nudes, confirming the findings of Costell et al.

Abstract = {Reviews the book, Hungochani: The History of a Dissident Sexuality in Southern Africa by Marc Epprecht (2004). Marc Epprecht has written a scholarly and rigorous history of 'dissident sexuality' in South Africa. Epprecht avowedly began this research in order 'to test the homophobic and xenophobic claims of certain Zimbabwean leaders against the empirical evidence' and also to expand his own understandings as a scholar and 'expunge' the heterosexism of an earlier research project. His in-depth yet wide-ranging examination of the archives provides ample evidence of the longevity of same-sex sexual relations--whether non-penetrative thigh sex or penetrative sex--among African men. He argues that these practices did not undermine but supported traditional versions of heterosexuality as key to reproduction and community. Despite a discussion of queer theory and the history of sexuality in the introduction, the historical account in later chapters does not fully connect to the initial discussion and, where particular queer theorists and activists, who have engaged with Southern African sexualities, are mentioned, the account given of their arguments does not quite get what they are saying. Overall, it provides a major contribution to the history and historiography of sexuality in southern Africa and stands as a major achievement.

Cass (see record [rid]1980-25477-001[/rid]). The GIQ is used to identify gay males in the various stages of homosexual identity formation. The test construction procedures included the selection of questionnaire items based on the HIF model, establishment of interrater and interitem reliability for those items, and refinement of the GIQ through 2 pilot tests. The final version of the GIQ was administered to 225 males who reported having same-sex fantasies or engaging in homosexual behavior. Demographic and psychosocial data were collected and used to describe the sample and examine the relationship of these variables to subject stage of HIF. Results support the use of the GIQ as a brief measure for identifying subject stage of homosexual identity formation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Studied children with adequate intelligence who performed poorly in school to discover whether the characteristics of academically handicapped children could be more precisely identified and described, and to clarify further the causes and familial patterns of learning disorders. 76 quartets of children and their parents made up the sample. Included were 76 educationally handicapped (EH) children and their same-sex siblings, and 76 academically matched successful children and their same-sex siblings. The EH children were compared with their matched controls and with their siblings on educational, psychological, and medical variables. The EH and control parents were contrasted on their adult reading ability, their high school transcripts, and their perceptions and attitudes toward their children. 5 subgroups within the EH population were identified. Neurological, emotional and familial factors were not as clearly delineated as has been popularly supposed. Definitive damage to the CNS was not an important antecedent for learning disorders in this population; subtle signs of different neurological functioning, e.g., speech disorders and coordination problems, were apparent. Familial learning disorders were clearest in the children with markedly high performance discrepancies on the WISC. Sibling concordance on many variables and parental language disabilities emphasized familial factors. Emotional antecedents were critical for the high-IQ and social-deviant groups. Moreover, the emotional climate was frequently more unfavorable for the EH child within the total family constellation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The group contingency condition was staggered in a multiple baseline fashion across the 2 response classes. Results indicate that regardless of sex, group contingencies were more effective than individual contingencies in increasing positive sexual-social interactions. Findings imply that emotionally disturbed adolescents' social interactions represent difficulties of performance rather than competence.

Abstract = {Comments on the article by J. Z. Ayanian and P. D. Cleary (see record [rid]1999-10831-003[/rid]) that concludes that most smokers do not perceive themselves as being at increased risk for experiencing a heart attack or for developing cancer based on answers to the question: 'Do you think your risk of heart attack (or cancer) is higher, lower, or about the same as other (men/women) your age?' The current author suggests that the conclusion reached may be unwarranted based on answers to this question. First, there is strong evidence that the context of a question can have a significant effect on how respondents interpret the question and on what information they use to help them answer. Because the questions about risk were asked separately from questions about smoking, some smokers may not have considered their smoking behavior when evaluating their risk. Second, the question asks respondents to judge their risk of disease compared with that of others of the same sex and age. Since smokers have more friends and relatives who smoke than do nonsmokers, the respondents' reference groups likely included smokers with disease risks similar to those of the respondents. To prevent such uncertainty, researchers should place questions in an unambiguous context. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Abstract = {Reviews literature from 1976 to 1982 on the sex composition of small groups. Three theoretical explanations for male–female differences in same- and mixed-sex groups are summarized: sex-role differentiation, status characteristics/expectation states theory, and R. M. Kanter's (1977) structural numerical proportions model. Five categories of empirical findings—nonverbal effects, verbal interaction frequency and content, negative assessments of influential females, negative consequences of 'token' or 'solo' females, and contradictions in findings on all-female groups—are also outlined. Interventions for transcending group sex-composition effects are identified for males and females in same-sex groups. It is concluded that research confirms the manipulation of proportions of males and females in mixed groups to improve the group experience for females and that additional interventions (e.g., legitimation, competency, motivational training) are required for females to receive results and benefits equal to males in mixed groups.

Ss were administered a test battery that included reading achievement tests and the AVI task as well as estimates of general intellectual ability, auditory memory, comparison of auditory patterns, and comparison of visual-spatial patterns. Evidence for heritable variation in reading achievement measures and AVI were generally significant. Factor analysis of the battery supported the idea that the integration aspect of the AVI task was the aspect of this skill related to reading achievement rather than auditory memory or visual-spatial ability. Data on family environment suggested that exposure to and emphasis on intellectual and cultural activities also promoted reading achievement.

Abstract = {Examined 71 monozygotic and 34 same-sex, dizygotic twin pairs (aged 6–11 yrs) residing in a metropolitan area to differentiate those risk factors that have the potential to respond to environmental and lifestyle changes. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triceps skinfold thickness, body mass, and fasting blood specimens for lipid profiles were collected during home visits. Teachers rated the Ss' Type A behavior and 2 of its subcomponents, impatience-aggression and competitive achievement-striving. Significant heritability estimates were found for Type A behavior and its subcomponents, triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure, and body mass. There was substantial environmental influence on these risk factors, particularly with respect to high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein-B, and diastolic blood pressure.

Abstract = {Investigated the effects of density, sex, and group size on pedestrian walking speed by observing 24 male and 24 female pedestrians walking alone and 24 pairs of male and 24 pairs of female pedestrians walking in same-sex dyads. Significant main effects were found for each of the independent variables. The decreased rate of walking velocity in the high density situation is interpreted in light of S. Milgram's (1970) overload theory. The decreased performance of dyads as compared to individuals is attributed to the velocity of the dyad adjusting to that of the slower member and to the fact that 2 Ss walking together move with somewhat less agility than a single individual walking alone. Results illustrate the need to incorporate the psychological and geographical behavior of individuals and dyads into the development of design standards for safe and efficient pedestrian walkways.

Abstract = {26 socially anxious (SA) and 26 non-socially anxious (NSA) individuals, aged 18–41 yrs, were assessed for indicators of physiological arousal (i.e., heart rate and blood pressure), type of cognitions, and behavioral indicators of skill and anxiety within the context of a series of interpersonal tasks. These assessments included an unstructured interaction with an opposite-sex confederate, a similar interaction with a same-sex confederate, and an impromptu speech. Results indicate that physiological reactivity occurred in SA Ss in most social situations and to some extent in the NSA Ss. An additional physiological index by which to differentiate the groups appeared to be latency to habituation. SA Ss failed to habituate during social encounters, and this could explain the continued presence of subjective distress. SA Ss had an increased number of negative cognitions and fewer positive cognitions. Situational factors appear to mediate the absolute level of reactivity. It is hypothesized that therapies that deal with cognitions directly, such as cognitive restructuring or self-efficacy training, might be more effective than those that affect thoughts indirectly, such as social-skills or relaxation training.
